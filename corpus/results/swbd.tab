41583:10	and so when i'm teaching a class *t*-1, obviously i wear a suit or dress,	no	frag	no	no		when			'm	
41587:47	so. it, it, uh, definitely fluctuates mainly with what i'm going *-1 to be doing *t*-2 that day and kind of what my mood is *t*-3	no	frag	no	no		what			'm	
41587:89	so. it, it, uh, definitely fluctuates mainly with what i'm going *-1 to be doing *t*-2 that day and kind of what my mood is *t*-3	no	frag	no	no		what			is	
41591:7	and when it's raining *t*-1, i'm more likely *-2 to wear jeans	no	frag	no	no		when			raining

41708:24	because they were not that careful in how they handled themselves in those mini skirts *t*-1.	no	frag	no	no		how			handled	
41712:154	and so, i think, uh, uh, of course, now i go the other extreme, 0 i do not like *-1 to see, in the corporate areas, uh, all the women dressed *-2 like men, with the suits and, uh, white shirts and ties and what have *t*-3 you so that they all look exactly the same.	no	rc	no	no	see	what			have
