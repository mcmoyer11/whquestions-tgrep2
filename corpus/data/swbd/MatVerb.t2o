257:120	think , \] 0 you know for myself \[ I , \+ I \] see that as probably \[ the , \+ the , \] what everything would hinge upon *T*-1
279:143	changing because , you know , uh , now that so many more minorities , where they have had extended families for such a long time *T*-2
291:192	choose *-1 not to deal with the , extended family because we feel 0 it 's kind of cumbersome , when in reality it makes things much much easier *T*-2
331:188	think that , you know , \[ we always , \+ \] uh , I mean , \[ I 've , \+ I 've \] had a lot of good experiences \[ with , \+ uh , with \] \[ many \+ many \] people especially where they 've had , uh , extended family *T*-1

630:19	'm not sure exactly where DANCES WITH WOLVES was filmed *-1 *T*-2
668:74	overreact occasionally when somebody tells me 0 it 's that great *T*-2
676:51	's what I really like *T*-1
719:13	know who he is *T*-1
749:26	listening Sunday night a little bit when , I was going *-1 to pick up my daughter *T*-2
755:60	is that when you make a movie like that *T*-2 , and you produce it *T*-2 , and then you star in it *T*-2 , uh , the question is , \[ did he , \+ did he \] really know 0 it was going *-1 to be good
761:25	think 0 it was something that he really wanted *-2 to do *T*-1
770:13	know who the guy *ICH*-3 was *T*-2 that *T*-1 was playing \[ \[ the , \+ uh , the , \] \+ the \] wagon driver

850:17	says 0 when the conversation is over *T*-1 * just say your good-byes and hang up
868:37	think 0 in a good example on the typical thing that *T*-1 happens , uh , when the phone rang *T*-2 E_S and it 's T I 0 *T*-3 calling , E_S my immediate reaction is that it 's some sort of strange phone message

885:97	think that I receive \[ on , \+ on \] the order of , uh , probably , seven or eight a week calls of the nature where one wishes that there were a convenient way 0 *-2 to just hang up on it *T*-1 *T*-3
896:66	recognize what , they are *T*-1
901:45	finish what it has *T*-1 0 *-3 to say *T*-2
904:24	's what *T*-1 makes one feel invaded
918:74	guess 0 I 'm not typically feeling invaded in my privacy relative to \[ this second , \+ this one \] that you raised *T*-1
937:61	guess , 0 although , \[ I , \+ \] well , that 's a good point where you said that how does one define what invasion of privacy is *T*-1 *T*-3 *T*-2 , because , uh , if that 's the case of a tree falling in the forest
937:75	said that how does one define what invasion of privacy is *T*-1 *T*-3 *T*-2
937:88	define what invasion of privacy is *T*-1 *T*-3
967:97	found out something *RNR*-1 or surmised something *RNR*-1 that *T*-2 were n't true
984:32	was just about *-1 to write a letter when I heard 0 they canceled it *T*-2
1020:68	was , um , that it was uncontrolled access to who *T*-1 would have that information
1032:41	tell it , what a company really has *-1 to do *T*-2 with it

1049:80	thought about it , \[ was of , \+ \] uh , *-1 waiting *-2 to talk to you that , another thing that *T*-4 occurred to me is 0 there is not so much invasion of my privacy because I know how *-5 to behave *T*-6 such that there is n't *?*
1049:139	know how *-5 to behave *T*-6 such that there is n't *?*
1064:40	is the closest 0 you can come *T*-1 , which *T*-3 is really quite different

1103:66	realized 0 that 's actually something that *T*-1 's culturally relative
1107:91	know how *-3 to say private *T*-4
1112:41	wonder how people have sex *T*-1 , and things like that

1121:75	understand how certain things that I assume 0 *T*-2 and require privacy and require not just that you be alone but actually that you have a sense of privacy *T*-3

1187:30	hate that when I 've got a whole bunch of messages *T*-1
1200:37	think 0 a law should be passed *-1 to where any of these people
1224:121	put up signs *ICH*-1 out front that *T*-2 says no solicitations
1233:16	was n't even what I would consider *T*-1 , you know , family hours
1261:49	said 0 the apartment complex puts up signs that *T*-1 says no soliciting *T*-2
1265:17	know how much clearer it can be *T*-1
1267:52	guess 0 I should make \] another one that *T*-1 says religious or otherwise , cause I still get
1311:16	remember what it was *T*-1
1390:27	know 0 when my mother was \[ a , \+ \] you know , going into the work force *T*-1 there was n't very many opportunities for her , I guess

1592:72	cuts \] down on your absenteeism because you 've got two days off that you can do everything *T*-1

1635:60	know 0 she probably did n't make hardly anything , you know , compared to the work that she did *T*-1
1639:33	think 0 there is still some discrimination there where \[ as , \+ \] you know , men and women work in the same job *T*-1
1730:60	is \] when it becomes militant *T*-2 , or , if it 's , uh , violence oriented

1773:39	's pretty funny how often I know all of the words to songs that she 's listening to *T*-1 *T*-2
1773:72	's pretty funny how often I know all of the words to songs that she 's listening to *T*-1 *T*-2
1786:139	think 0 it 's kind of absurd , you know , the fact that , you know , \[ they do n't really , \+ they do n't really \] give , you know , the original artist , or the original composer , the credit that *T*-1 is really due to them
1792:73	guess 0 there was even \[ a , \+ a \] bit of ruckus caused * by the M C Hammer , who *T*-1 's really , you know
1803:16	remember who the artist was *T*-1 on that
1850:55	's like , you know , God , what are they doing *T*-2
1877:36	saw him in a concert , when I was
1886:18	think that probably what *T*-1 did it for him was the fact that he was a good stage performer
1895:25	is what it seemed like *T*-1
1915:40	know what you 're talking about *T*-1
1931:26	showing when , \[ we , \+ we \] think that *T*-1
1935:27	think , um , um , 0 when

2086:82	write down how much we have *T*-1 coming in each month

2224:28	know what he would do *T*-1
2312:60	being customer oriented , uh , which *T*-2 falls in line with the T I culture here at Texas Instruments
2316:69	is 0 if you 're not serving the customer , you better be serving someone who *T*-1 is *?*
2333:39	am into some things *ICH*-1 occasionally that I do n't think of *T*-2 in terms of self improvement
2344:172	do what you really want *-2 to do *T*-3
2364:37	figured out why that one was last *T*-2
2364:61	is how * to manage engineers *T*-1
2392:92	's what I 'm involved in *T*-1 a lot at work
2405:122	understand \[ what , \+ what \] it is *T*-1 0 we 're saying

2566:82	is wear we 're going *-3 to draw the line *T*-4

2646:18	am more productive when I 'm in pants *T*-1
2730:59	's \] mainly who they 're going *-1 to meet with *T*-2
2731:78	's how they are *T*-1
2751:12	wonder what kind of money does he make *T*-1
2805:37	tell you what ours has been like *T*-2 then
2923:19	went by when the wind was less than fifteen or twenty miles an hour *T*-1 . Summer and winter
3001:46	ask him what it was *T*-3
3045:29	wondering why we had somebody from Maryland though *T*-1
3066:21	's what we 're supposed *-1 to do *T*-2
3075:101	end it when * needed *-1 *T*-2
3159:92	's \] really when I grew up *T*-3
3164:17	's really what I like *T*-1 better

3332:19	was real popular when I was growing up *T*-1
3372:49	buy it . E_S Because see , what *T*-1 happens is , the old , see whe-

3419:37	's \] what *T*-1 gets me mad
3431:14	saw it when it opened *T*-1

3477:32	found out what a lot of the seventies music had *T*-1 too
3525:27	's what I mean *T*-1
3540:21	know what they 're called *-1 *T*-2 , you know
3555:22	's what they 're calling them *T*-1
3584:34	's \] why I guess , everybody

3720:16	's wha-
3720:36	's what \] we mostly do *T*-1 , pretty simple things
3764:11	's what
3779:29	was about a year or so ago , when we went *T*-1
3793:68	's Owens Country Farms 0 *T*-1 has a free petting , you know , like a farm that you can go to *T*-2
3903:60	feel almost ashamed *-1 to say that to anybody now because I have never met anybody who *T*-2 likes it
4069:11	's why I say , did you stay up late *-2 to watch this RED DWARF *T*-1
4174:35	think 0 what they are trying *-1 to say *T*-2 , is that there is a great deal of historical truth , E_S but 0 the interpretation that *T*-1 actually got into the writing of the Bible itself is probably uh , after the what , uh , \[ was \+ is \] it *T*-2 the King James Version when the committee \[ did it , \+ wrote the translation *T*-4 , \] that so much was lost *-3 in the translation , particularly since most of the translations were in Greek

4293:24	's because somehow that implies to me 0 it 's not fun , or something like that
4299:29	feels like if it 's something that you have *-1 to do *T*-2 , you know , if you look at it as if you have *-3 to do it , then \[ it becomes , \+ it becomes \] a chore
4310:37	enjoy it when it 's a chore *T*-1
4323:81	regulate how much exercise I get *T*-1 a week
4403:16	love it when , you know , it 's swimming weather *T*-1
4444:16	know where they actually started *T*-1
4449:19	is how well the fads catch on elsewhere *T*-1
4467:31	's curious , 0 I do n't know why , do n't know if it 's
4486:40	been some progressive medical schools *EXP*-1 out here , that *T*-2 have taken that approach
4502:22	say \[ which , \+ which \] *T*-1 caused the other

4528:64	'm not sure if it was a meditation practice , or if it was , you know , \[ which *T*-1 is \+ \] similar to a stress management practice or alternates to , uh , A M A approved medicine

4849:15	look how many years they 've been doing that *T*-1
4894:26	are what we teach *T*-1
4898:14	's what our society becomes *T*-1

5103:59	adding and using another color *ICH*-2 instead , you know , what *T*-1 comes close
5221:34	seen the afghans *ICH*-1 in the stores that *T*-2 are designed *-3 for cross-stitching
5238:67	know that I had done it in the colors , that they had decorated the nursery *T*-1

6552:29	was of age when the Peace Corps came in , and all that *T*-1
6568:12	's what I was wondering about *T*-1
6585:33	see what *T*-2 would happen if you took kids \[ at a , \+ \] and then took then to another country instead of * having being exposed *-5 to all the drugs and violence and sex and everything here , and take them to some other country that *T*-3 had different moral values , like Saudi Arabia where they could n't drink *T*-4

6600:41	wonder if * being exposed to that for a while , what percentage of them *T*-1 would actually say , Hey , that 's not a bad way 0 * to do it *T*-2
6640:18	know how they 'd enforce it *T*-1
6683:46	think 0 it might build jobs for people , you know , that *T*-1 were administrating and running and training and coordinating and all that
6696:72	determine \] what these people do *T*-1
6714:68	be , um , some scandals involved * , if , you know , it was n't people that *T*-1 were really fair and \[ le- , \+ you know , in a legal \] way or something
6737:49	Suppose , uh , well , you know , 0 they had a group who *T*-1 were construction oriented

6841:47	have elderly couples *ICH*-4 once their kids have left , that *T*-2 can volunteer *-3 to go on a mission
6889:11	see how they were organized *-1 in , Central and South America *T*-2
6950:11	's what I do *T*-1
6954:11	's what I do *T*-1
6980:17	use it whenever I feel like I do n't want *-1 to write a check *T*-2
7056:36	know where they determine *T*-2 that I 'm such a good credit risk that they can go and say , you get this much credit line
7076:90	's interesting , uh , that , uh , people have \[ the , \+ generally the \] same view . of credit cards , no matter where you go *T*-2
7135:24	is what we 've been selected *-1 to discuss *T*-2 today
7173:18	know how that is *T*-1

7460:176	decide which *T*-3 are the good aspects *RNR*-6 and which *T*-4 are the bad aspects *RNR*-6 of a candidate
7490:117	get upset about it , too , because , you know , every year \[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ the \] politicians are the ones that *T*-1 are usually pushing for more people to vote
7498:86	thinks 0 it 's going *-1 to be the people that *T*-2 come out that *T*-3 will vote for him

7506:30	know that there 's certain issues that *T*-1 can really motivate people because we live in a \[ \[ pr- , \+ pr- , \] \+ predominately \] Catholic type area
7528:30	's true that the different places in America that , uh , you know , different issues would be a lot more important than say in another place
7531:18	understand \[ why , \+ why \] some of \[ the , \+ the \] rural areas , the voter turnout is n't as much because it does seem sometimes like the lobbyists in D C are like controlling things for \[ the , \+ the \] Midwest *T*-1

7581:85	seems like people with old-fashioned values are the ones that *T*-2 are n't turning out \[ at the , \+ at the \] booths

8241:14	's good when you go to Tom Thumb *T*-1 though
8432:49	told him what all we wanted *T*-1
8504:129	's like \[ the , \+ the \] beginning of the semester when you go *-2 to pay for everything *T*-3 , everything is pretty rough

8745:21	was \[ that , \+ that

8858:34	do *T*-1 when I 've got some spare time *T*-2
8859:104	know what you would call them *T*-1
8916:21	's kind of what my wife says *T*-1
8981:48	disconnected *-1 when I 'm talking to them *T*-2
9034:62	find out when a good time for zucchini is *T*-2
9090:56	guess 0 it 's the stuff that *T*-1 comes out of automobile exhaust , you know
9098:98	think that those are bigger contributors than things like \[ ai- , \+ acid \] rain and some of the pollutants that *T*-1 come from , uh , industrial areas , factories and so on
9133:132	know if you \[ he- , \+ \[ re- , \+ \] heard \] about the , uh , recent legislation in , uh , Colorado , uh , against a power company , uh , that *T*-1 's actually on Indian land , I believe 0 *T*-2
9154:148	could n't do the , uh , piloting , uh , you know , the helicopter trips and that sort of thing . Which *T*-1 would be horrible , because \[ the , \+ there 's \] nothing
9174:42	know what we can do *T*-1 as individuals
9203:38	suspect that that 's one thing \[ that , \+ that \] as individuals , we can do *T*-1 , * make our voices known , perhaps to our legislators
9203:46	suspect that that 's one thing \[ that , \+ that \] as individuals , we can do *T*-1 , * make our voices known , perhaps to our legislators
9205:16	's probably how we ought *-2 to do it *T*-1 . Uh , \[ individ- , \+ *-2 being individually responsible \] \[ as , uh , gro- , \+ in order *-3 to be group responsible
9208:49	guess 0 \[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] to the point where I 'm cynical enough that I really do n't believe 0 anything will happen \[ unless , \+ unless \] there 's something economically justifiable about it *T*-1
9212:136	be so costly *ICH*-4 *ICH*-5 * to have *-3 to live with air pollution in terms of health problems , and everything else that we 'll spend the money that *T*-6 's necessary * \[ to , \+ uh , to \] get rid *-2 of the source of it
9212:156	be so costly *ICH*-4 *ICH*-5 * to have *-3 to live with air pollution in terms of health problems , and everything else that we 'll spend the money that *T*-6 's necessary * \[ to , \+ uh , to \] get rid *-2 of the source of it
9217:107	suspect \[ that the pub- , \+ \] that there 's going *-1 to have *-2 to be a lot of pressure , uh , come * to bear on the companies that *T*-4 deal with it
9222:25	know how long \[ that , \+ that \] will take *T*-1
9276:16	's what they
9276:35	's what they
9285:11	's what they say *T*-1
9293:80	tell a difference in \] the comfort level , uh , particularly in the summer . Uh , you know , when it gets hot *T*-1 , and you have , \[ the , \+ that \] kind of a pressure from the pockets of air , uh , usually they say caused * by exhaust *T*-1
9307:34	suspect that we 've probably covered everything that we need *-1 to *?* *T*-2 here
9445:91	guess 0 I 've been in some places , you know , where the weather was just so mild *T*-1 , you know , places like Monterey , California or , you know
9464:103	get along with monotony in the weather when it 's very temperate *T*-3
9489:53	guess 0 we 're supposed *-1 to say good-bye or something , and think about what
9582:7	See what we can come up with *T*-1 . E_S
9617:49	keep it on just a minimum amount of time , really when they 're up *T*-1
9636:29	remember it when I was younger *T*-1 \[ of , \+ \] you know , *-2 catching it on P B S
9667:35	comes on from like nine to ten , which *T*-1 is a good time
9691:22	repeat over again . Which *T*-1 is also
9726:25	look what we can do *T*-1
9815:32	had one when I was really little *T*-1
9848:32	tell me \] where you 're calling from *T*-1
9920:32	saying , well why should I go *-1 do that *T*-2
9927:18	know how * to act yet *T*-1
9993:34	play baseball when I was a kid *T*-3
10005:24	think , uh , 0 what *T*-1 caught so many of our attentions last year was that Nolan Ryan , you know
10082:30	watch the Giants when they come to Houston some times *T*-2
10136:28	know how familiar *ICH*-2 you are *T*-1 with him
10330:23	's like , all right who *T*-1 comes first
10341:21	's like all right , whose corners *T*-1 is this one
10369:13	knows what *T*-1 happened to him
10402:12	wonder how many of his lives he missed *T*-1 , when that happened *T*-2
10402:38	missed *T*-1 , when that happened *T*-2
10453:41	feel like they need a big home , a nice place where someone can have the time 0 *-1 to play with them and things *T*-2 *T*-3
10458:33	go hysterical when they do n't come home *T*-1
10530:16	asked the vet why he did that *T*-1
10531:44	weaned *-1 *-4 too young , which he was *T*-2 , because his mom was killed *-3
10570:35	had \] a dog when I lived at home *T*-1
10680:23	got her when I moved out of the house also *T*-1
10694:21	's how I am *T*-1 about Xanadu
10767:11	's how life goes *T*-1
10804:12	wonder how truthful all of that was *T*-1 or whether there was fiction
10876:100	think 0 it was more *ICH*-1 a lesson for Tom Cruise *ICH*-2 than anything else in terms \[ of , \+ uh , of \] how * to act *T*-3 from Dustin Hoffman
10880:47	was , \] uh , what \[ the , \+ much of the \] hype was *T*-1 that Tom Cruise learned so much from Dustin Hoffman
10883:71	seeing how he prepares \[ for his , \+ for his \] lines *T*-2
10886:42	filmed *-1 right in Cincinnati . Which *T*-2 is just forty-five miles \[ from , \+ from \] \[ where I am *T*-4 , \+ where I actually live \] in a suburb of Dayton *T*-3
10886:83	filmed *-1 right in Cincinnati . Which *T*-2 is just forty-five miles \[ from , \+ from \] \[ where I am *T*-4 , \+ where I actually live \] in a suburb of Dayton *T*-3

10910:162	was when he , uh , dropped \[ the , \+ the , \] uh , the toothpicks *T*-2
10965:58	have \[ a , \+ a \] brother *ICH*-1 myself \[ that *T*-3 's , \+ that *T*-2 's \] older
10965:73	have \[ a , \+ a \] brother *ICH*-1 myself \[ that *T*-3 's , \+ that *T*-2 's \] older
10987:79	's \] one of these guys *ICH*-4 though that *T*-1 does n't really like *-2 to go *-3 see movies like that
11096:11	's what I do *T*-1
11135:39	's not the right people , which *T*-1 is \[ really , \+ really \] sad because , I wish 0 we would do more
11141:15	think 0 what *T*-1 started it at work was that planet earth thing 0 we had *T*-2 last year
11190:101	was one thing 0 we noticed *T*-1 last week that we had some new people move into our building E_S and , you know , the nice cardboard boxes that you move , packing boxes . And they were just used *-1 one time and thrown *-1 in the dumpster
11211:14	's exactly what I did *T*-1
11252:68	go \] to the grocery store and stuff and get those boxes , when , you know , these are perfect *T*-1
11274:14	's exactly what I do *T*-1
11280:12	's what I do *T*-1 with a lot of my daughter 's things
11349:39	think 0 there 's two of them , that *T*-1 have several openings
11421:22	is discouraging \[ when you , \+ when you \] do that *T*-1
11421:34	is discouraging \[ when you , \+ when you \] do that *T*-1
11429:56	feel like I 'm \[ doing , \+ uh , doing \] something for the community when I 'm doing that *T*-1
11521:11	's why I was thinking 0 it could n't be just a totally funny part *T*-1
11534:23	think 0 the last movie that we went out *-1 to see *T*-2 was DANCES WITH WOLVES
11557:23	cried the first time when \[ the , \+ um , the \] wagon man got killed *-1 *T*-2 , when they attacked him *T*-3
11557:69	cried the first time when \[ the , \+ um , the \] wagon man got killed *-1 *T*-2 , when they attacked him *T*-3
11570:12	cried when the horse got killed *-1 *T*-2 and when the wolf got killed *-3 *T*-4
11570:36	cried when the horse got killed *-1 *T*-2 and when the wolf got killed *-3 *T*-4
11573:16	remember when the horse got killed *-1 *T*-2
11584:33	been such a pal to him , when he was alone *T*-1
11631:37	know that it was n't same situation that the buffalo died in *T*-1
11636:26	thought 0 the scenes when the buffalos running *T*-1 , though , were beautiful
11656:11	wonder how they kept up with them , though *T*-1
11677:35	teach a wolf how *-3 \[ to , \+ to \] howl *T*-2
11753:37	's just a point that I have observed *T*-1 that we
11790:16	tell me what you think 0 *T*-1 contributes most to , uh , air pollution
11826:30	sits in just over the line , where T I 's plant is *T*-1
11833:11	depends which way the wind 's blowing *T*-1 from Boston , cause we 're like forty miles south of Boston
11865:92	be visible , uh , what *T*-3 's coming out of your smokestack
11873:37	got this black ash *ICH*-3 on their cars , which *T*-1 , you know , seems *-2 to be
11925:30	's \] what I was , uh
11959:85	's interesting because New Hampshire , and parts of Vermont , um , they showed pictures \[ of , \+ of \] extensive tree damage that they attributed *T*-1 to acid rain
11968:16	's what the environmentalists were claiming *T*-1 in this article

13361:24	got one tonight about six thirty when I sat down *-1 to eat dinner *T*-2

13499:33	have *-1 to do a lot of troubleshooting when the programmers have installed a new system *T*-2

13540:90	's exactly what I do *T*-2
13568:11	's what we have *T*-1
13594:115	determine what we 're going *-1 to do *T*-2 with Contel after we bought Contel
13644:29	think 0 the change that I 've seen *T*-1 as much as anything is one where couples , uh , are more carefully planning their intention on how *-3 to both share homemaking duties *T*-4 and also how women will , uh , have their children and then deliberately sort of plan how they go back to the work place *T*-6 *T*-5 *T*-2

13648:31	guess 0 that 's a significant change that I 've both participated in *T*-1 \[ an- , \+ and \] noticed *T*-1
13656:19	wondered why they allowed , or let , you know , both the father and mother go *T*-1 , uh
13670:104	see what differences a child being brought *T*-3 up , you know , in \[ a , \+ uh , kind of a , \] uh , community , rather than a home
13680:47	know , uh , 0 in my children 's case it was one where , uh , pretty much up until the older of two was \[ in , \+ \] uh , * let 's see , I guess basically starting junior high E_S and the younger was in fifth grade when my wife reentered the work force *T*-2

13897:83	think that we have a bunch of elderly folks in the country that *T*-1 could use some help
13907:24	teaches kids how * to grow *T*-1
13911:53	is 0 back , well , when I was a kid *T*-2 , and much earlier than that , kids were kind of , \[ i- , \+ i- , \] N_S you know
13926:25	seem like when they get ten or twelve years old *T*-1 they fall out of that
13936:32	know what the high rank *ICH*-2 is *T*-1 for the gals
13992:61	address what we 've done *T*-2 here
14044:49	do real well where it 's
14053:24	'm pleased when I have an opportunity * to hear just the facts *T*-1
14083:16	know which that answer is *T*-1
14090:54	used *-1 to watch SIXTY MINUTES until they did two programs , uh , that I knew both the people and the \[ inc- , \+ incidences *T*-2
14094:39	knew that they had presented an extremely slanted viewpoint , that *T*-1 was , in my estimate , nowhere near truth but was much better for ratings

14110:40	know how \] old you are *T*-1
14111:38	seems to me like the last , uh , newscaster that *T*-1 presented news in just the nice simple factual way that I wanted *-2 to hear *T*-3 was Walter Cronkite
14111:69	seems to me like the last , uh , newscaster that *T*-1 presented news in just the nice simple factual way that I wanted *-2 to hear *T*-3 was Walter Cronkite
14139:13	's where I \[ get , \+ get \] into the problem \[ with , \+ with \] him *T*-1
14160:25	understand a lot what *T*-1 was going on
14164:86	think 0 it helps me everyday in *-1 trying *-2 to review \[ wh- , \+ \] the state that the world is in *T*-3 and try *-2 to guess where we 're going *T*-4
14164:120	guess where we 're going *T*-4
14166:55	help 0 you sometimes fill in the gaps or recognize discrepancies that \[ other people , \+ people like myself \] might not pick up on *T*-1
14168:53	is probably what *T*-1 absolutely turned me off with SIXTY MINUTES
14214:44	to bring one *ICH*-4 in that *T*-3 was a little bit better for us , so * to speak
14246:31	's , an interesting alternative *ICH*-3 occasionally that I like *-1 to use *T*-2
14291:45	know who your favorite team is *T*-1 , actually
14433:32	was his shoulder , was n't it *?* , that he had the problems with *T*-1
14447:21	done , where I work *T*-1
14470:24	look at the clock when we started *-1 talking *T*-2
14491:22	know who else I 've ever
14516:59	growing up \[ when , \+ when \] the Cowboys were really big *T*-2
14516:67	growing up \[ when , \+ when \] the Cowboys were really big *T*-2
14523:39	was when they started *-1 kind of going downhill really *T*-2
14553:45	is what it 's going *-1 to do *T*-2
14560:34	figure out where you could get
14626:13	's how we learned about it *T*-1
14664:47	is \] that , um , what *T*-1 happens is \[ as , \+ \] that \[ you 're , \+ uh , you know , as you \] go from the country to a city , crime always increases , right
14677:32	is 0 all those that *T*-2 do n't have any money in the country move to the cities
14679:13	say , why ca n't we have the same things that these other people have *T*-1 *T*-2
14730:67	telling us how * to recognize when kids were on drugs *T*-2 *T*-3 , how * to recognize the pushers outside the one entrance , that they were giving their drugs away in order *-4 to get the kids started * *T*-5
14730:81	recognize when kids were on drugs *T*-2 *T*-3

14735:59	figure out how * to cope with the problem *T*-3 because it has grown so huge
14752:34	is that the people who *T*-1 are the dealers , the big dealers in drugs , \[ may be , \+ may be \] part of the power structure that *T*-2 's keeping us from * spending the money in that direction
14752:108	is that the people who *T*-1 are the dealers , the big dealers in drugs , \[ may be , \+ may be \] part of the power structure that *T*-2 's keeping us from * spending the money in that direction
14796:18	goes , hey , how you doing *T*-1
14829:73	know what * to do *T*-1 with it
14916:25	is *?* especially when you work out of town and everything , that way *T*-1
14940:78	see what damage I have did *T*-2
14957:14	're there when you need them *T*-1 . You know , like in emergencies , or whatever
14957:54	're there when you need them *T*-1 . You know , like in emergencies , or whatever
14997:36	pay it off when it comes in *T*-1
15000:54	's one way 0 * to do it *T*-1 , because \[ that , \+ that \] forces you to pay for it instead of *-2 saying , well , I 'll just pay on it this month
15071:67	say that , uh , \[ it , \+ you know , the people who *T*-2 do it , \] well , some feel 0 it 's rewarding
15073:23	know how we got the subject *T*-1 , MUMBLEx
15100:11	's how we know each other *T*-1
15154:47	seems to me like the Peace Corps , E_S they send you someplace that there 's a lot of bugs *T*-1 MUMBLEx
15165:15	know how it is *T*-1 MUMBLEx
15172:25	's why some people do it *T*-1
15192:46	come back where they left off *T*-2
15207:85	decide what they want *-2 to do *T*-3
15216:74	gone in the military , I mean , you know , when they 're in the college *T*-1
15221:35	know what they want *-1 to do *T*-2
15222:76	suppose 0 there 's a few people that *T*-1 have done it at that point in their lives
15223:45	think 0 a lot of it 's , you know , when \[ the- , \+ \] people get older *T*-1 , they 'll do something like that
15225:41	have a different perspective if I actually knew someone that *T*-1 had gone into the Peace Corps
15239:38	know anyone *ICH*-3 first hand \[ that *T*-1 's , \+ that *T*-2 's \] \[ com- , \+ committed \] a chunk of their life *-4 to do service work

15254:78	know what I marked *T*-2 off *-3 to get this
15312:13	forget exactly what the focus was *T*-1 on that one
15350:33	gotten a one of them yet when I 've called *T*-1
15385:39	told \] me when he gave it to me *T*-1 that it was impossible 0 * to kill *T*-2
15463:16	remember what they said 0 his name was *T*-1
15489:41	guess 0 he was taking Kevin Costner to like the site where he was going *-1 to be *T*-2 or whatever

15580:42	tell when it was coming *T*-1
15599:16	was just how she got so caught up *T*-2
15665:49	think 0 they may be playing up um , some aspects of the movie that *T*-1 are n't the main aspects
15728:13	's where most of our , uh , injuries occur *T*-2
15753:21	know how T E C would handle it *T*-1
15871:43	single them out when we started *T*-1 , you know , that they were going *-2 to do all them first

16217:59	drain the water out of the watermelon because , you know , when you scrape it *T*-2 , it makes the water
16313:21	know what you 're talk-

16970:113	seems as though if you really want *-2 to set \[ a t- , \+ \] side time 0 * to read the Bible *T*-1 and you work \[ and \+ and \] whatever , uh , that pretty well takes up your time for reading
17103:20	explain who people are *T*-1

17426:21	know who I 'm talking about *T*-1
17443:11	's why I like *-1 to watch that MASTERPIECE THEATRE on channel thirteen *T*-2 , because they 'll take a classic \[ and , \+ and , \] uh , televise it you know , put it into a viewing format , more or less
17522:29	's not just the exercise that *T*-1 's boring and time consuming
17566:18	's nice because when the weather 's bad *T*-1 \[ you ca n't , \+ you do n't \] have any excuse
17665:28	found that , uh , when you write things down and set goals *T*-1 it *EXP*-2 's a lot easier * to \[ keep , \+ uh , keep \] something going
17675:67	see how much you improved *T*-1 over the weeks
17831:19	was back when , uh , you know , the high impact and
17868:66	found that \[ they , \+ they \] have just a much better program than the other shows that *T*-1 are on T V
18003:16	's what

18004:140	is 0 they do n't explain to the jurors , \[ \[ in a , \+ in a \] trial , \+ in a capital murder trial , \] or in cases of rape , or in different things that *T*-2 are so horrible , what it means *T*-3 when they sentence them to , you know

18106:39	know what their capital punishment is *T*-1
18112:42	think \] 0 \[ Texas is wha- , \+ Texas , \] the southern states seem *-1 to be somewhat more conservative and still have the death penalty

18216:20	was n't that way when I was younger *T*-1
18327:29	know \[ what , what i-

18374:65	start *-1 to get real expensive because there 's an awful lot of work that *T*-2 has *-3 to be done *-4 * chopping through the rock
18394:64	is what part of town we lived in *T*-2 because he said , uh , \[ I 've got , \+ I 've got \] a dozen different varieties

18647:16	see how anything can survive out there , for long periods of time *T*-1
18673:46	decide \[ \[ what , \+ what \] * to , \+ what *-2 to \] put *T*-3 on one side of the house and things like that

18834:39	figure out how they can help you do different things *T*-1

19204:53	quit that about \[ two years ago , \+ no , three years ago \] when we got china mugs for everybody *T*-1
19229:79	believe 0 everybody is starting *-2 to pay attention and take heed of what *T*-3 is happening

19266:59	seen *-3 as , you know , whoever *T*-1 was the head of \[ the , \+ the \] communist party was seen *-2 as , you know , untouchable
19295:70	's amazing just because of the drain that *T*-1 's been on , you know , both economies that our economy \[ is , \+ \] of course , been able *-3 to , uh , withstand that a little better
19301:16	know what the percentages are *T*-1
19318:79	steps on too many people *ICH*-3 's toes , who *T*-1 are comfortable with the way 0 the situation is *T*-2
19324:42	think , you know , 0 what I 'd have *-1 to
19374:63	was like somebody \[ in the , \+ in the \] Red Square or wherever said , okay
19502:42	guess , 0 what they 'd have *-1 to do *T*-2 * to
19505:15	hope that what *T*-1 's happening is exactly the way 0 it appears *T*-2
19510:80	's kind of a strange thing 0 we 've been trying *-1 to make something like this happen for so long that when it finally happens *T*-3 you say , whoa , * wait a minute
19512:11	knows what * to do *T*-1
19521:13	wonder how , well , this thing
19549:19	read *T*-1 when the , uh , \[ lee- , \+ \] uh , United Nations was setup *-2 \[ in , \+ in \] San Francisco *T*-3
19601:16	's what they 're saying *T*-2
19614:22	was , uh , what kind of books do you read *T*-1 for entertainment
19681:99	say 0 the last , \] you know , honest to gosh , cover to cover book that I read *T*-2 , I can not , right offhand , I tried *-3 to read , uh , one of \[ the , \+ the \] Michener , uh , LONE STAR or \[ the , \+ the \] TEXAS HISTORY BOOK
19737:129	made *-2 * to placate some of the northern support but not completely alienate all the southern support because , you know , \[ it was , \+ uh , if you read it , it only emancipated \] those who *T*-1 were in areas , uh , in rebellion against the United States
19744:17	know what else *T*-1 really surprised me , now
19792:119	managed *-1 to hold off \] the whole Union navy for a while from *-2 coming up the Sabine River which *T*-3 was of no consequence but still is an interesting story
19794:18	know , why they actually held them off *T*-1
19840:58	know where the Mason Dixon Line was *T*-2
19906:36	read HAWAII , when I was about ten years old *T*-1
19916:54	remember which other one it was *T*-1
19950:19	's where my folks all came from *T*-1
19983:29	reading DUNE . Which *T*-1 seeming rather ironic
19997:66	think 0 that 's probably my favorite \[ of , \+ of \] any piece of science fiction that I 've ever read *T*-1
20018:21	guess 0 the guy that *T*-1 's on the new STAR TREK series was in that thing , uh
20027:83	figure out , what they were talking about *T*-1 , at all
20146:275	said that , uh , instead of the , uh , hundred and fifty thousand or so who *T*-2 wanted *-3 to immigrate to this country , we cut that by , uh , two thirds
20184:39	learn what they are *T*-1
20186:77	think 0 in a way , though , uh , uh , I also have , uh , an opposite point of view , which *T*-1 is , uh , 0 although I believe 0 we should , uh , permit , uh , you know , constant immigration into this country uh , \[ I think 0 we should , \+ uh , primarily for economic reasons , I think 0 we should \] have , um , some quotas
20204:182	think 0 if immigration was entirely unrestricted , uh , not only \[ would , \+ would \] the United States become \[ over populated , \+ well , more over populated \] awfully quickly , I think 0 *T*-3 \[ it , \+ it \] would bring in a lot of , uh , people that *T*-1 are , run *-2 out of other countries or in trouble \[ in , \+ in \] other countries
20214:99	know whether they 're laws passed * \[ or , \+ or \] whatever they 're called *-4 *T*-1
20214:134	were \] some , uh , regulations *ICH*-2 over , E_S I do n't know whether they 're laws passed * \[ or , \+ or \] whatever they 're called *-4 *T*-1 , uh , just recently , where , uh , people with certain diseases can not be excluded *-5 , uh , from , uh , immigration *T*-3
20256:74	think that we have a government and we have a lot of freedoms , and we have a lot of things that the governments do *T*-1 with our money
20272:87	figure out how * to cut budgets or cut spending \[ or , \+ or , \] you know , get all of the waste out of the spending *T*-4
20276:21	know what y'all are paying *T*-1 in Dallas
20281:50	paying almost eight percent sales tax , right now . Which *T*-1 seems to me nuts
20363:19	Render unto Caesar 's what *T*-1 is Caesar 's
20371:30	thought of those two things when \[ I was , \+ I was \] holding for a long time *T*-1
20385:16	's what they were trying *-1 to do *T*-2 with the tax situation
20386:23	's when he said well you render unto Caesar 's what *T*-1 is Caesar 's *T*-2
20386:52	render unto Caesar 's what *T*-1 is Caesar 's
20387:17	render unto God what *T*-1 is God 's
20411:16	get outraged when I feel like they go up for useless reasons *T*-1
20421:57	deal with taxes much in what you do *T*-1 when you work *T*-2
20438:17	notice that when they passed the new simplified tax act *T*-1 , it seemed like it made everything harder
20673:24	's where you 're from *T*-1
20689:18	's pretty much what I do *T*-1
20691:11	's what you do *T*-1 , uh
20717:30	's \] what he said *T*-1 here
20729:67	broadened , \[ our , \+ \] um , the devices that we 're making *T*-2 , too , which *T*-3 has made us as lot more stable
20758:56	know if you know , um , about what Louisville is doing *T*-1 with recycling
20761:32	know that we have some relatives that *T*-1 live around , like the MUMBLEx area in there
20770:79	haul it up to a Metco , you know , which *T*-1 is a real pain
20777:69	help you , recycle , because \[ we , \+ \] there is some bins , like behind Wal-Mart , that *T*-1 take some things
20795:50	take it when they 're open *T*-3 , you know ,
20795:79	take it when they 're open *T*-3 , you know , which *T*-2 is always a real pain
20820:14	's about what we do *T*-1 too
20825:72	guess , um , 0 down \[ in , \+ kind of in \] North Dallas , there is a place that *T*-1 will take almost anything
20916:65	recycling aluminum cans *ICH*-3 up here \[ and , \+ \] uh , just what you would buy *T*-1 out of the machines and drink *-2 here
20946:34	know 0 they 've started over in Richardson where my dad lives *T*-1
20970:42	find it during the day \[ when , \+ when \] I 'm rocking my little girl to sleep *T*-1
20970:50	find it during the day \[ when , \+ when \] I 'm rocking my little girl to sleep *T*-1
21095:57	recognizing what *T*-1 was going on
21112:39	know who the characters are *T*-1
21122:34	staying home , when I was five and six *T*-2
21186:25	's more into the animated stuff , where my other daughter liked puppets and that kind of thing
21222:11	's what I need *-1 to do *T*-2
21254:20	know why the two of them happen , *-1 to be my two favorite shows *T*-2
21330:54	like the old \[ ser- , \+ series \] better when , um Dede was in there *T*-1
21342:16	remember what her name is *T*-1
21349:23	's what they try *-2 to do *T*-1
21359:123	say that , uh , \[ that there was abso- , \+ that there was like a conflict \] between her and him , uh , that they never really could get her into , uh , any character that they could use *T*-1
21384:23	's what I did n't like *T*-1
21393:64	wondering , \] you know , well when did this happen *T*-1
21404:29	's what \[ they , \+ they \] really wanted *-1 to do *T*-2
21413:16	's what the public wants *T*-1
21416:14	's what *ICH*-2 I always enjoyed *T*-1 about it
21426:62	knew \[ which , \+ which \] one *T*-1 was going *-6 to show up . You know , whether it was going to , where they 're going *-2 to be real close *T*-4 or whether they 're just going *-3 to be partners *T*-5

21434:51	wonder , why they do n't , you know , get together or whatever *T*-1
21438:26	's what they decide *-1 to do *T*-2
21446:76	been a formula , uh , for T V \[ that the minute that two people , \+ that the two main stars \] get married *-1 *T*-4 , that the show ends up , you know , *-2 dying
21453:39	had what they called *T*-1 MAXIMUM SMART
21469:23	's what *T*-1 killed it
21474:20	died when they got married *-1 *T*-2
21509:56	guess 0 it 's falling back into our traditional stereotype which a lot of shows
21518:47	watch , um , what is that show *T*-1 , WHO 'S THE BOSS *T*-2
21535:46	think 0 they 're thinking about that exact thing , about the idea that if the show lets them , uh , get together , then you lose part of what the show 's all about *T*-1
21535:98	think 0 they 're thinking about that exact thing , about the idea that if the show lets them , uh , get together , then you lose part of what the show 's all about *T*-1
21542:18	's funny how \[ \[ we , \+ uh , we , \] \+ we \] romanticize people *T*-2
21553:23	's why most rock stars nowadays keep their marriages secret *T*-1 , or at least they keep it quiet *T*-1
21560:24	affected me when I was younger *T*-1
21573:58	publicized *-1 that there was no way that they could stay together *T*-2
21664:38	's what we 're doing *T*-1 tonight
21681:32	's coach pitch , until you get nine which my little boy will be *T*-1 nine in May

21920:20	see how we can get rid *-1 of the problem *T*-2
21957:11	's how I keep *-2 looking at it *T*-1
22037:32	's \] what *T*-1 happened to my brother

22335:38	'm not good enough *-1 to raise my child , which *T*-2 basically is true

22406:68	grab you , steal \[ you- , \+ your \] money and slit your throat which in a lot of big cities
22413:19	's what \[ you , \+ you 're \] going *-1 to have *-2 to expect *T*-3 that to happen

23075:41	go where they used *-2 to work *T*-3
23110:21	have programs *ICH*-1 around where you can reach the , uh
23132:94	noticed in one of the sales catalogs this weekend 0 they have \[ \[ a , \+ like a , \] \+ a \] clothes hamper kind of thing that , you know , you lay your string in *T*-1 , then you put your papers in there tie them all up and bundle them up

24467:56	find out \[ whether , \+ \] just how much of a people person they are *T*-1

24519:104	know 0 I certainly would n't want *-1 \[ to , \+ to , \] uh , you know , be endangered *-2 by somebody in a company that *T*-3 accidentally dropped something on me \[ or , \+ or \] you know , because he was on drugs while he was there
24535:106	think 0 your record should stand for itself .

24535:126	see what the big deal is *T*-2 that they have *-3 to go to all the expense of *-6 testing you over and over and over *T*-5
24549:31	is , \[ how , \+ how \] do you know 0 it 's done *-1 fairly *T*-2

24563:32	win millions of dollars where another person does n't win anything , and tries and tries and tries *T*-1 . You know

24617:25	feel afterwards when you came up *-4 negative and , you know , your supervisor has accused you of *-1 using drugs *T*-2 *T*-3
24622:46	think \] 0 almost the only way that drug testing can be done *-1 fairly *T*-2 is if it 's across the board \[ from , \+ from \] the janitors to the executive management
24665:60	know if I was n't drug tested *-1 based on that or because the man who *T*-2 hired me did n't request the drug test , because I know that my company does drug testing on occasion
24723:64	make that clear to them as they hire those guys \[ what , \+ what \] the drug testing schedule is *T*-1
24723:72	make that clear to them as they hire those guys \[ what , \+ what \] the drug testing schedule is *T*-1
24787:72	's the job that \[ the , \+ the \] high school and the grade schools are doing *T*-1 that I see , in a area like ours
24789:31	is a good school up here , where , if I lived in New York City or Washington , D C , uh , I would seriously consider * moving if I had a child
24801:59	know what *T*-1 's going on
24811:45	repeating what I 'd already done *T*-2 . Because we were so far advanced
24825:27	have that *ICH*-1 down there that
24834:111	's no reason that you should take college prep courses *T*-1 when you can get some general business courses in high school *T*-2
24843:56	gone so much further if I 'd gone to a school that *T*-1 was directed *-2
24860:16	know what * to do *T*-1
24885:14	see where that would n't be very good for \[ a , \+ a \] kid *T*-1 , you know
24909:60	wondering if that 's going *-1 to have any effect , you know , on what you see *T*-2 now
24924:24	know 0 the town that I come from *T*-1 \[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ uh , the \] large I B M plant has something 0 * to do *T*-2 with the top rated high school because of their tax base for one
24948:16	see where she 's going *-1 to have much time for them *T*-2
24961:166	see *RNR*-4 what they need *T*-1 and not overinflate it
24966:37	getting six percent raises every year when people in industry have been getting cut *-1 back , and you 're getting raises every eighteen months *T*-3

25019:44	getting what I should *?* *T*-1
25033:33	think 0 it just builds on the foundation that they 've already built *T*-1
25063:123	die because of it because they do n't understand , uh , you know , simple things from the amount of medicine 0 they should take *T*-3 to how fast they can drive *T*-4 and you know how far away something is *T*-5

25073:28	understand what an amount of something is *T*-2
25087:60	is why we keep *-1 wanting *-1 to do it *T*-2
25088:45	think 0 \[ they , \+ \] that 's an area that the other nations , especially Europe , look down on us like oh , we 're just backward wayward children who *T*-1 still use this backward system , who *T*-2 have n't really attained it yet *T*-3

25089:33	feel 0 it 's just pride of why they keep *-1 trying *-2 to push it on us *T*-3
25112:26	work when I was designing packages for people *T*-2
25136:20	know how much of the you know
25161:69	learned what a centimeter *ICH*-3 was *T*-2 and a decimeter and \[ the various , \+ you know basically the other \] alternate forms of measurements , things like that
25174:36	think 0 it failed , too , E_S because like what you said *T*-1 \[ of just , \+ \]
25180:117	figure out how much gas they 're really getting *T*-1
25241:13	's what I think 0 we ought *-2 to do *T*-1 with the metric system
25261:11	know what I mean *T*-1
25347:19	like it when it 's sort of a medium temperature , uh , maybe seventy-five to eighty , somewhere in there *T*-1
25348:19	like it when it 's too cool or too warm *T*-1
25349:39	'm much more apt *-1 to get things done *-2 when it 's at that sort of in between temperature *T*-3
25411:24	move very well when it 's that cold *T*-1
25551:72	guess , 0 the first time 0 I played golf *T*-1 has been probably about eight or ten years ago now , when I was in college *T*-2
25556:45	got \] into it \[ when I was , \+ while I was \] still in school

25580:64	played out here a couple of times in the middle of the winter when my parents came down and what not *T*-1

25664:73	tell \] you how * to do that *T*-2
25664:101	teach you how * to do that *T*-3
25703:13	's what I 'm trying *-1 to get her ready for *T*-2
25772:30	learn how * to hold one *T*-1
25772:55	learn how * to do it *T*-2
25788:26	enjoy what you 're doing *T*-1
26022:45	pay it when the bill comes in *T*-2
26089:14	's how we got in trouble *T*-1
26099:26	makes you feel good when you whip out the cash instead of your plastic *T*-1
26158:11	remember when they first opened up *T*-1
26250:60	seeing how people interact with them *T*-1
26275:17	is what I 'm looking at *T*-1 right now
26374:53	check out \[ what the , \+ uh , what the , \] uh , foreign cars were *T*-3
26374:70	check out \[ what the , \+ uh , what the , \] uh , foreign cars were *T*-3
26503:36	remember what the name is *T*-1
26525:11	's how expensive they were *T*-1
26542:76	force me to get my driver 's license when I was young *T*-2 when I was sixteen *T*-3
26542:93	force me to get my driver 's license when I was young *T*-2 when I was sixteen *T*-3
26571:21	's very easy when \[ you get a top- , \+ you get on a topic \] that , you know , you enjoy *T*-1 *T*-2
26571:65	's very easy when \[ you get a top- , \+ you get on a topic \] that , you know , you enjoy *T*-1 *T*-2
26612:31	specify , you know , exactly what young means *T*-1
26641:59	think 0 it *EXP*-2 would be a good thing though , * to encourage other people who *T*-1 are n't even aware that they can do such a thing . to get out there and do so
26674:53	receive a letter *ICH*-3 in the mail , that *T*-2 says , you know , \[ you need *-1 to report somewhere by next Monday , \+ you know you need *-4 to report somewhere by next Monday , \] you know
26680:51	think so either because a lot of people , um , depending on how the public service programs are set *-1 up *T*-2
26731:47	think 0 it ca n't be something that *T*-1 's mandatory
26736:52	be something that *T*-2 's voluntary . You know , which *T*-3 is pretty much the way 0 it is *T*-4 now
26740:55	'm not even really sure *ICH*-2 at this point in time , you know , \[ what , \+ what \] programs *T*-1 are out there
26740:63	'm not even really sure *ICH*-2 at this point in time , you know , \[ what , \+ what \] programs *T*-1 are out there
26772:61	do something like that . Although there are a lot of kids who *T*-1 would do it *-2 just to get away from their parents
26787:28	wonder , you know , what kind of quality job would they do *T*-1 , you know
26804:19	know who *T*-1 's even proposing it , \[ or , \+ or \] how they plan on *-2 implementing it *T*-3 , if they do
26804:57	know who *T*-1 's even proposing it , \[ or , \+ or \] how they plan on *-2 implementing it *T*-3 , if they do
26844:66	think , that they could get some results from that , because there are a lot of people who *T*-1 are volunteer and community minded
26848:18	know where * to go *T*-1 *-2 \[ \[ to , \+ to , \] \+ to \] do anything
26870:83	guess 0 Kennedy \] may be the one that *T*-1 actually started the thing , or was , you know , really interested in things like that
26875:31	know what programs *T*-1 \[ are , \+ are \] even ongoing now , you know
26923:60	see how I was going *-2 to like it *T*-3
26958:42	's what I taught *T*-1
26977:16	's what I got my certification in *T*-1
26985:60	was 0 I do n't like \[ the , \+ uh , what 's the right word *T*-1 . The \] varied inappropriate influences that you find *T*-2 so much in the public schools

26992:35	think 0 they could cover everything that you could teach , your children *T*-1 on an individual basis
27003:16	matter what you do *T*-2
27034:23	asked him , uh , what are you doing *T*-1 with that
27052:26	understood \[ what the , \+ what the \] kid was doing *T*-1
27052:38	understood \[ what the , \+ what the \] kid was doing *T*-1
27054:62	say 0 he was one of \[ th- , \+ those \] types that you would n't doubt that *T*-1 he was selling something
27061:21	had the problem when I was in , N_S with *-1 teaching , um
27062:22	was eighth and ninth graders that I worked with *T*-1
27083:18	were better behaved when they were , um
27084:39	know if * was alcohol or something else that they were on *T*-1
27119:16	seen how their school system works *T*-1
27140:37	's \] a great deal what law school 's like *T*-1
27159:13	's how well you can remember it all *T*-1
27247:29	like school when I was going through it *T*-2
27247:97	see that it 's a lot better than what we have *T*-1 now
27257:90	handcuffed *-2 when it comes to discipline *T*-1
27291:64	think , \] 0 \[ I , \+ I \] mean what we 've turned the school schools into *T*-1 now are just day-care centers
27322:16	know what the answer is *T*-1
27358:43	reading a few cases about \[ that \+ \[ when it , \+ when \] \] some people first tried that *T*-1
27358:55	reading a few cases about \[ that \+ \[ when it , \+ when \] \] some people first tried that *T*-1
27406:14	see where those spackling marks were *T*-1
27427:14	forgotten what it was *T*-1 0 you put *T*-2 down , and then you can just paint right over the dark
27467:53	see what it *EXP*-4 costs *T*-3 * to have something painted *-5
27518:29	's just remarkable how close it will match the paint *T*-2 , uh
27547:26	's one of the problems though when you start *-3 painting *T*-2 * to try *-1 to get the , you know
27619:11	's what we 're trying *-1 to get ours to look like *T*-2
27630:84	know what you \[ call that *T*-1
27659:32	did that all the way around the room which *T*-1 makes it look very attractive
27663:54	makes the room look smaller \[ which *T*-1 is , \+ uh uh , which *T*-2 is
27669:16	explains \[ why they , \+ why they \] have everything white *T*-1
27669:28	explains \[ why they , \+ why they \] have everything white *T*-1
27698:19	know that when we bought the house *T*-1
27716:27	bled under the masking tape which , I guess , *T*-1 is probably the topic 0 \[ we 're \+ we 're \] really on to *T*-2 \[ that , \+ that \] the masking is
27756:29	guess 0 I got away from what I consider *T*-1 to be the pot , uh , sounding music
27757:20	have \[ what , \+ you know , I guess 0 *T*-2 what \] I was looking for *T*-1
27757:52	have \[ what , \+ you know , I guess 0 *T*-2 what \] I was looking for *T*-1
27777:45	was one of the nerdy types in high school really which *T*-1 meant that \[ I , \+ for one reason or another I \] did n't pay much attention to music
27779:55	saw *T*-1 perform when I was in college *T*-2
27786:49	think 0 that was just through * experiencing contacting college and the fact that I found \[ it , \+ it \] very relaxing for me
27795:11	know what I like *-1 to listen to *T*-2 as far as classical music
27819:40	guess 0 one of the things \[ was \+ \] that *T*-1 influenced me was that \[ I , \+ I 've \] worked in radio stations as a D J for all my college years *-2 trying *-3 to support my way through there , E_S and suppor- , N_S was support
27820:52	's where I worked *T*-1
27822:74	said 0 he used *-1 to sit on Saturday mornings and watch cartoons just *-3 to hear the music , uh , that they were using *T*-2 behind them because they used , especially Disney used *RNR*-4 a lot of classical music , uh , behind the cartoons
27839:16	know which *T*-1 is chicken and egg in that situation
27861:90	spent my \[ junior year , \+ uh , and sophomore and junior \] year \[ in , \+ in \] college when I
27867:22	recall how it goes downtown , ta , da , da , da *T*-1
27907:78	understand what is *T*-1 that other people take *T*-2 for granted , in composition themes
27907:88	understand what is *T*-1 that other people take *T*-2 for granted , in composition themes
27912:28	are something *ICH*-1 to me that *T*-2 remain a mystery no matter how many times I bang *T*-3 on them
27932:50	turns out 0 I was the only one who *T*-1 really had an interest in it and never got *-2 to *?*
27973:57	do because I 've seen a lot of those changes , the changes that women have had *T*-1 in \[ the last genera- , \+ well , you know , not even the last generation , \] the last fifteen years twenty years , * going from
28015:16	see how the generations go *T*-1
28051:40	know when they 're going *-1 to be there *T*-2
28106:159	learning how * to deal with society *T*-1
28133:27	think 0 that 's the thing that we 're going *-1 to see *T*-2
28150:12	's what I 'm doing *T*-1
28226:11	is what you do *T*-1 it now
28255:37	is \] how it was drilled *-1 into you *T*-2 when you were a kid *T*-3
28255:63	drilled *-1 into you *T*-2 when you were a kid *T*-3
28271:32	think 0 \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] going *-1 to show up a lot more now , \[ in the , \+ in the \] next generation \[ of , \+ of \] boys and girls
28297:65	think 0 in between we got \[ a group of kids , \+ a generation of kids \] who *T*-1 did n't learn *-2 to take responsibility because mom left *-3 to go *-4 get a job and dad did n't move in *-5 to fill the gap
28320:22	doing what they want *T*-1
28329:18	felt like when they were young *T*-1 , that was the time 0 *-2 to instill it *T*-5 . That \[ it could be , \+ it could be \] added to *-3 and strengthened *-3 as they grew older , but 0 when they were little *T*-4 , you know

28339:22	does anything when they 're little *T*-1
28461:59	knows what they 're doing *T*-3
28478:53	got a couple of portable lap top P C 's *ICH*-4 at the office that I end up *-1 bringing one of *T*-2 them home a lot , *-3 to do work
28484:77	know how they were going *-1 to do without me *T*-2 at work because , I am pretty much \[ the , \+ like you said , the \] guru , in the office with the different programs and MUMBLEx any trouble shooting that there is *T*-1

35039:20	's surprising how much it 's changed *T*-1
35081:17	understand why , first of all , the public puts up with it *T*-1 . Second of all , why the networks think that , you know , we enjoy that kind of stuff *T*-2
35081:70	understand why , first of all , the public puts up with it *T*-1 . Second of all , why the networks think that , you know , we enjoy that kind of stuff *T*-2
35127:64	say , all right , what did you see *T*-2 on WHAT *T*-1 'S NEW
35127:83	say , all right , what did you see *T*-2 on WHAT *T*-1 'S NEW
35178:13	know how everybody 's doing *T*-1
35197:11	know what I did *T*-1
35282:35	was *?* when it started *T*-1
35447:12	's what I 'm thinking about *T*-1 on my next car
35455:94	wonder why did the person that *T*-3 owned it want *-4 to get rid *-5 of it *T*-6
35455:107	wonder why did the person that *T*-3 owned it want *-4 to get rid *-5 of it *T*-6
35686:29	's kind of what I decided *T*-1
35698:32	said which dealers *T*-1 participated \[ in the , \+ in the \] fleet program *T*-2
35715:105	guess 0 I got a pretty good deal , because I went back to the Town North Mazda right off Central and offered them the same price as what I knew 0 I was going *-1 to be able *-2 to get it for *T*-3 in Arlington
35733:108	's where the white one was *T*-1
35748:18	laughed real hard when I took it in for the two thousand mile checkup *T*-1
35761:29	knew what *T*-1 was going on the very next day
35766:39	told him 0 there 's a place in Arlington that *T*-1 's going *-2 to give it to me for that price
35807:52	know if it 's their proposal or one that *T*-1 's being seriously kicked *-2 around
35842:30	went in the service when I was eighteen *T*-1
35863:20	's , uh , how he put himself through school *T*-1 basically
35895:31	going two semesters when I got out *T*-2 just *-3 to get my degree
35930:81	throwing *T*-1 away *-3 to pay people to go out and do things when we 're paying all these welfare recipients *T*-2
35975:91	said that if the money that *T*-2 goes into welfare each year was *-3 to be given *-4 directly to the people without all the middle people in the government bureaucracy , each person would receive like forty-five thousand dollars *T*-5
36006:46	wonder , okay , how much money do we need *T*-2
36073:14	taught them how * to do it *T*-1
36117:30	know 0 why they do it *T*-1 is so they can get them out of the house
36140:45	learned how *-1 to do things differently *T*-2
36207:49	bet you 0 there 's a whole bunch of homeless people up there who *T*-1 would take that job for thirteen thousand dollars a year
36240:42	's really what *T*-1 happened to the steel industry in this country
36281:16	care what kind it is *T*-1
36390:23	do it whenever you want *T*-1
36402:38	guess 0 it depends on the person , depends on how motivated you are *T*-1
36424:72	think 0 you really have *-1 to *?* , at least twice a week , just *-3 to maintain the shape that you 're in *T*-2
36440:21	's a little harder when you 're depending on other people 0 *T*-3 to do it with you *T*-2 because you have *-1 to meet their schedules as well
36444:38	doing it more when I 've got other people with me *T*-1
36488:24	know how much you 've been through *T*-1 it
36516:22	think , 0 that 's what the class that *T*-1 meets on Saturday mornings
36516:32	think , 0 that 's what the class that *T*-1 meets on Saturday mornings
36664:16	know how you can really keep , uh , the inside of a tent clean *T*-1
36733:54	's when it 's usually
36740:44	gets cooler when the sun sets *T*-1
36748:17	noticed how effective they were *T*-1
36759:33	think 0 in an area that *T*-1 's really thick with mosquitoes
36771:11	's what I do *T*-1 when I wait for a phone call *T*-2
36771:25	do *T*-1 when I wait for a phone call *T*-2
36825:26	're also , um , flimsy when you really look at them *T*-1
36836:26	have a problem , uh , when he went *-1 camping last year in Beavers Bend , \[ Ok- , \+ Oklahoma *T*-2 , \] um
36847:42	do *T*-1 when you get \[ a , \+ I mean , like a \] really violent storm like a tornado *T*-2
36866:29	decided that , that was enough camping for the weekend
36873:40	helping several other people *ICH*-2 though \[ that *T*-4 were , \+ that *T*-3 were \] stuck
36873:55	helping several other people *ICH*-2 though \[ that *T*-4 were , \+ that *T*-3 were \] stuck
36884:44	think 0 some \] people that *T*-1 had fairly sturdy , um , vehicles or whatever if they had like a Winnebago or something and they were farther in away from the water , I think 0 they stayed
36884:72	think 0 some \] people that *T*-1 had fairly sturdy , um , vehicles or whatever if they had like a Winnebago or something and they were farther in away from the water , I think 0 they stayed
36935:78	consider , what they can do *T*-1 with the rest of the world
36946:65	's just a matter of time , because , in the Baltic States they have already massacred so many people who *T*-1 protested
36954:89	realize that , uh , uh , the Bush Administration is n't too happy \[ with , \+ with \] how they 're handling their internal , uh , strife *T*-2 , you know , as far as diplomacy is concerned *-1
36958:94	gave him more power as far as his republic in Russia is concerned *-1 , which *T*-2 \[ is , \+ \] gives him more power overall , which I think 0 *T*-3 is a good sign that there will be some , you know
36958:135	gives him more power overall , which I think 0 *T*-3 is a good sign that there will be some , you know
36984:23	's where Yeltsin steps in *T*-1 , so far as his politics of government goes
36985:18	know how convinced *ICH*-1 the people are *T*-2 of him yet , myself
36995:98	is \] that Gorbachev is the one that *T*-1 opened the floodgates , as far as with glasnost and \[ poistro- , \+ perestroika \] and stuff
36999:43	think 0 it 's kind of escalated to a point where it 's out of control *T*-1
37003:59	think 0 he had *-1 to pull in the reins the only way 0 he knew how *T*-2 , in order *-3 to keep the \[ peace on , \+ peace on \] both sides
37004:27	's \[ where \+ you know , , kind of where \] he 's stuck *-1 *T*-2
37004:50	's \[ where \+ you know , , kind of where \] he 's stuck *-1 *T*-2
37005:11	know what I 'm saying *T*-1
37020:33	think that because of the basic needs that the people do n't have *T*-1
37021:81	think 0 that , uh , makes the problem most severe , and makes him \[ look , \+ look \] worse that \[ what his , \+ um , what his \] ideals are *T*-1 , personally
37021:99	think 0 that , uh , makes the problem most severe , and makes him \[ look , \+ look \] worse that \[ what his , \+ um , what his \] ideals are *T*-1 , personally
37028:72	think 0 it 's \] a lot of , uh , oh , how do you put it *T*-1 ? , bureaucracy \[ and , \+ and , \] uh , one thing , and then all the corruption
37052:42	's \] what *T*-1 happens when , you know , the cork blows *T*-2 E_S and you ca n't handle it anymore
37052:53	's \] what *T*-1 happens when , you know , the cork blows *T*-2 E_S and you ca n't handle it anymore
37057:27	question , though , how much technology the average Soviet is exposed *-1 to *T*-2
37064:77	filtered down enough to the common folks that they have gotten wind , of what they 're missing out on *T*-1
37068:173	think 0 they have the resources , if you were *-1 to compare , uh , the Americans to the Soviets as far as home computers *ICH*-3 are concerned *-2 or \[ fact machines , \+ Fax machines \] and cellular phones , and state of the art equipment that we are so used to *T*-4
37069:30	realize what *T*-1 's out there , and to what extent
37069:54	realize what *T*-1 's out there , and to what extent
37078:70	is real luxury . Which *T*-1 is unfortunate for them
37082:41	appreciate what we 've got *T*-2 because we 've been so used to it
37091:57	have what other people have *T*-6
37091:82	's when you tend *-4 to realize , you know , what *T*-1 's out there and \[ what , \+ you know , what \] you have *T*-3 and what you do n't have *T*-2 *T*-5
37091:116	realize , you know , what *T*-1 's out there and \[ what , \+ you know , what \] you have *T*-3 and what you do n't have *T*-2
37091:139	realize , you know , what *T*-1 's out there and \[ what , \+ you know , what \] you have *T*-3 and what you do n't have *T*-2
37091:157	realize , you know , what *T*-1 's out there and \[ what , \+ you know , what \] you have *T*-3 and what you do n't have *T*-2
37091:176	realize , you know , what *T*-1 's out there and \[ what , \+ you know , what \] you have *T*-3 and what you do n't have *T*-2
37106:91	see that occurring . Uh , because their internal strifes are more important *ICH*-2 right now than * concentrating on any kind of outside affairs that they used *-3 to be adapted *-1 to *T*-4 I guess
37183:96	's a good change for I think women to be able *-1 to fulfill their potential in whatever they feel , you know , 0 their expertise may be *T*-2
37196:13	's where the problem is *T*-1 really
37226:63	feel like you 're looked down upon *-1 by people that *T*-2 go back to work and so you 're just wasting your time , at home
37328:57	get where they are *T*-2
37337:27	's hard though when you talk \[ about , \+ about \] families \[ and , \+ and \] * raising children *T*-1
37343:54	are n't real flexible when it comes to things like that *T*-1
37359:34	being what it ought *-1 to be *T*-2
37386:68	adopt \] teams when I \[ \[ wen- , \+ go to a tea- , \] \+ uh , go to a town *T*-1
37432:70	find that , \[ \[ tha- , \+ tha- , \] \+ there 's \] a connection between that and how they do *T*-1 in Spring training the following year
37463:43	's \] an interesting concept , though , when you look at , uh , \[ of , \+ of \] \[ how baseball , \+ how apparently
37463:88	's \] an interesting concept , though , when you look at , uh , \[ of , \+ of \] \[ how baseball , \+ how apparently
37463:100	's \] an interesting concept , though , when you look at , uh , \[ of , \+ of \] \[ how baseball , \+ how apparently
37490:54	think 0 that 's \] part of what , uh , baseball needs more of *T*-1
37491:50	guess 0 what *T*-1 bothers me \[ is , \+ is \] that when you go *T*-2 , um , you wait and wait and wait
37491:86	is \] that when you go *T*-2 , um , you wait and wait and wait
37521:50	know how Oakland 's going *-1 to react to *-2 being , uh , swept *-3 in the World Series last year *T*-4
37522:41	take that as a challenge . Which *T*-1 is the way 0 most teams \[ nat- , \+ you know , naturally \] do *T*-2
37548:25	think 0 that 's all that they have *T*-1
37581:70	's \] not a great indication because there have been teams that *T*-1 have just , you know , come out and just won all kinds of games in Spring \[ crani- , \+ training \] and then gone on a , you know , fourteen game losing streak in the first of the season
37585:15	seems that what you really need *-1 to do *T*-2 *-3 to win though , is * to have a team that *T*-4 has reasonable talent and has some people that *T*-5 \[ \[ have , \+ have , \] \+ have \] real breakthrough years
37585:76	seems that what you really need *-1 to do *T*-2 *-3 to win though , is * to have a team that *T*-4 has reasonable talent and has some people that *T*-5 \[ \[ have , \+ have , \] \+ have \] real breakthrough years

37590:29	is how do you forecast that *T*-1
37597:38	think 0 the \] best thing that you can do *T*-1 is * go with , um , the players \[ that *T*-6 are , \+ that *T*-2 have \] the talent 0 * to do the best years *T*-4 . And , um , that *T*-3 they had n't had these , uh , gigantic , uh , career years yet \[ and , \+ and \] just kind of assume that , you know , \[ so- , \+ one \] of them is going *-5 to break through eventually
37597:88	think 0 the \] best thing that you can do *T*-1 is * go with , um , the players \[ that *T*-6 are , \+ that *T*-2 have \] the talent 0 * to do the best years *T*-4 .

37651:26	's really what *T*-1 's been hurting , uh , the , uh , Rangers
37675:66	coming to a point *ICH*-1 real soon when ticket prices are going *-2 to be to the point where the average fan ca n't go *T*-3 *T*-4
37675:101	coming to a point *ICH*-1 real soon when ticket prices are going *-2 to be to the point where the average fan ca n't go *T*-3 *T*-4
37695:97	think 0 baseball probably feeds on a number of people that *T*-1 can go out there , you know , several times a
37698:45	are so many games *ICH*-1 \[ in , \+ in \] a year that they 've got *-2 to have repeat customers
37731:63	doing what they 're doing *T*-2
37801:30	teaching him what we can *?* *T*-2 at home , of course , because , uh , I guess 0 we do n't trust the school system , which *T*-3 is very sad
37801:105	trust the school system , which *T*-3 is very sad
37813:80	going *-1 to try *-2 to teach him good values , because , you know , \[ \[ we- , \+ when , \] \+ when \] they get to upper level school *T*-6 and they start *-3 teaching them , well hey , if you can play football or basketball that 's what *T*-4 's important *T*-6
37813:88	going *-1 to try *-2 to teach him good values , because , you know , \[ \[ we- , \+ when , \] \+ when \] they get to upper level school *T*-6 and they start *-3 teaching them , well hey , if you can play football or basketball that 's what *T*-4 's important *T*-6

37813:183	's what *T*-4 's important
37841:60	see 0 on down the road , you know , where we do have kids and are getting to that age *T*-1 , that 's going *-2 to be a definite concern
37845:51	think 0 there 's only going *-1 to be one solution to school funding which I do n't think 0 *T*-2 will be necessarily the best way
37846:17	think 0 what *T*-1 's going *-2 to have *-3 to happen is 0 there 's going *-4 to have *-5 to be tuition for grade school and junior high and high school kids
37865:107	affect the people that *T*-1 are having kids in school , of course , which *T*-2 is probably the only fair thing 0 * to do *T*-3
37869:113	going *-1 to really hurt \[ the , \+ the \] middle class , uh , people , I think 0 *T*-4 . Because , uh , they 're the ones that *T*-2 will probably have *-3 \[ to , \+ to \] carry the brunt of the load
37899:17	think \[ what , \+ what 's \] it going *-1 to be like *T*-2 for \[ \[ my , \+ my youngest , \] \+ \[ an \+ \] my oldest \] son , when he goes to school *T*-3
37899:25	think \[ what , \+ what 's \] it going *-1 to be like *T*-2 for \[ \[ my , \+ my youngest , \] \+ \[ an \+ \] my oldest \] son , when he goes to school *T*-3
37899:113	be like *T*-2 for \[ \[ my , \+ my youngest , \] \+ \[ an \+ \] my oldest \] son , when he goes to school *T*-3
37913:27	was *?* when I was going to school *T*-1
37924:45	be like *T*-2 in another twelve years when my , uh , oldest son is in high school *T*-3
37933:30	guess 0 what you have *-1 to do *T*-2 is * just , uh , keep \[ in , \+ \] uh , you know , *-3 encouraging them \[ and , \+ and , \] uh , uh , try *-3 to be open with them , so that \[ y- , \+ you \] can deal with the problems as they come up
37940:80	be your child 's best friend , I guess 0 *T*-3 , even when they 're a teenager and they , you know are kind of standoffish *T*-2
37944:35	got *-1 to be their best friend because when they 've got problems *T*-2 , who they going *-3 to go to *T*-4
37944:56	got *-1 to be their best friend because when they 've got problems *T*-2 , who they going *-3 to go to *T*-4
37968:54	get after them and have a lawsuit . Which *T*-2 is going *-3 to take twenty years 0 * to resolve *T*-4
37978:24	's where they
37978:43	's where they \] get \[ the , \+ the \] deep rooted values *T*-1
38200:51	're \] pretty handy because , you know , when I travel *T*-1 , it *EXP*-2 's easy * to check messages
38243:42	get real high powered stuff now for under two thousand dollars , where , you know , just a few years ago it would have been six , seven , eight , nine thousand dollars *T*-1
38246:96	guess 0 \[ \[ it 's not , \+ it 's all , \] \+ you know , it 's , inexpensive \] compared to what it used *-1 to be *T*-2
38319:93	do what they needed *T*-2
38396:29	took one home \[ when they , \+ when \] \[ they had it , \+ you know , they had a \] big deadline coming up *T*-1
38396:41	took one home \[ when they , \+ when \] \[ they had it , \+ you know , they had a \] big deadline coming up *T*-1
38424:23	know who they 're talking to *T*-1
38432:17	know who I am *T*-1
38433:18	know who they are *T*-1 , you know
38492:37	are , um , I guess what you 'd call *T*-1 self improvement type of books
38536:16	know what the chains are *T*-1 down there
38577:44	guess 0 I 've got so many books like that that I need *-1 to read *T*-2
38653:37	was of the people from there that *T*-1 said that
38718:20	know when I 'm going *-1 to get to them all *T*-2
38823:65	is probably one of my biggest ones , because it 's the type of thing that \[ you can , \+ you can \] do *T*-1 a little bit at a time , whereas
38838:29	take it wherever you go *T*-1
38843:39	neglect what I should be doing *T*-1
38890:31	remember how * to do it *T*-1
38975:14	reading when you called *T*-1
39037:19	's so nice though when you have a nice yard full of flowers *T*-1
39084:36	think 0 when I was real little *T*-1 I probably had a finger in on that every time 0 he did it *T*-2 and had *-3 to be out there and watch and that type of stuff
39127:38	helps because it 's the time of the year that they 're shedding a lot *T*-1 , and * cleaning cat fur off the couch and off the floor is not a hobby of mine
39190:57	know when they might bite or scratch or something *T*-1
39344:11	's what I do *T*-1 too
39353:11	's what I 've got *T*-1
39397:30	know \] what you mean *T*-1

52725:196	lose out , when people go so far out to the extreme , on either side *T*-4
52751:13	's why , you know , I 'm like , okay , what 's my role in this thing *T*-1 , , you know , what 's my part *T*-2 *T*-3

53072:11	's what my girlfriend says *T*-1
53079:19	says 0 that where we need *-1 to go *T*-2 sometime
53092:22	remember what type of trees they are *T*-1
53348:27	find out where they 're from *T*-2
53408:43	see what *T*-1 's going on
53424:34	is n't , you know , pretty much what we \[ loo- , \+ look \] for *T*-2 anyway

53446:53	figure out who *T*-2 's going *-3 to get the best headlines
53450:51	try *-1 to play public 's opinion . Which I think 0 *T*-2 is awful , because it usually works
53460:35	see what *T*-2 happens

53540:28	wonder why we did n't go ahead and go on in and , finish the job while we were in there *T*-2
53546:13	understand why Bush , you know , does n't want *-1 to go in \[ and , \+ and \] uh , take sides *T*-2
53643:26	was between six and eight inches here where we are *T*-1
53703:53	relate to that , because I have two kids that *T*-1 are opposites like that
53707:44	know what you 're talking about *T*-1
53737:40	think 0 the only \] thing that they would argue *T*-1 about that , is that , you know , every child needs *-2 to learn every subject

53780:38	's , \] basically what they 're doing *T*-1
53810:16	know where you 're from *T*-1
53812:48	talking about the Plano school system , that , they had one school that , uh , if the students did something wrong , I mean , whether it was behavioral or , uh , you know , they were n't learning properly or something .

53815:44	said , Why is my child being put *-1 in this closet *T*-2
53837:21	said , \[ now what good does thi- , \+ I mean , how is this helping *T*-1

53891:64	think 0 \[ one of the positive things , \+ I mean , one of the things \] that *T*-1 can come out of , uh , is not just \[ di- , \+ discipline , \] okay
53893:71	have what they call *T*-2 , uh , * caught *-3 being good slips
53894:146	doing whatever they are supposed *-2 to *?* *T*-3

53913:28	do when they deserve it *T*-1 , you know
53934:75	can deal with a child without *-2 spanking them . Which *T*-3 is true
53937:23	do things that they need that
53986:21	's what I meant *T*-1 by salt that \[ we , \+ we \] did that like as a family , little ornaments and , things like that , and just kind of really got into it . Like during the Christmas season , *-2 making them up for other people and things like that

54253:114	have \[ a \+ like a \] totalitarian system , when it comes to the Palestinians *T*-1
54268:14	's just what do you do *T*-1 for them
54280:13	's what they did *T*-1

54640:23	did BATMAN *ICH*-1 also , which , you know
54654:22	's a lot in it when you look at the scenery and the cars , and all the different stuff like that *T*-1 , you know
54708:54	think 0 Roseanne Arquett *ICH*-2 was in it too , another one that if you blink you 'd miss *T*-1 her

54952:21	know what they 're all about *T*-1
54975:31	guess , 0 there are two basic teams that I seem *-1 to follow *T*-2 every year
55017:44	was probably the only one in the room several times when we were watching football on T V *T*-1 when the Cowboys were playing the Saint Louis Cardinals *T*-2
55017:72	was probably the only one in the room several times when we were watching football on T V *T*-1 when the Cowboys were playing the Saint Louis Cardinals *T*-2

55023:19	know what *T*-1 's going *-2 to take place with the Cowboys this year
55026:63	's quite a bit of optimism *ICH*-1 around here that still there 's a chance that maybe , uh , these guys are right , maybe they will come through \[ and , \+ and \] do something this year
55032:63	got a lot of names *ICH*-2 in that we \[ were n't , \+ were n't \] familiar with *T*-3
55041:24	done absolutely nothing when they got there *T*-1
55073:16	know why it *EXP*-2 's so hard * to find , uh , a good quarterback these days *T*-1
55096:77	is when the guys seem *-3 to really do their best *T*-4
55129:20	know how these changes are going *-1 to help or hinder the team *T*-2
55230:16	's what *T*-1 makes it a powder keg
55232:42	go back in time a little bit , to about eighty-one , when my first real involvement with the military started *T*-1
55278:144	do what the general tells them *T*-5
55281:22	's what *T*-1 concerns me the most
55281:112	Is 0 \[ they 're , \+ they 're \] so unstable that somebody like that could make , uh , decisions that *T*-2 would jeopardize a lot of people
55330:82	know 0 a lot of this stuff that I was involved in *T*-1 , never did make the newspapers
55335:29	bug you a little bit why they kept *-2 coming up with all this stuff *T*-3
55359:60	's scary * to know that they 're supplying that many people with weapons . Especially when it 's to the south of us *T*-2
55381:38	think 0 Russia is getting to the point where \[ they 're , \+ they 're \] about *-1 to do something *-2 to get out of communism *T*-3
55406:15	understand 0 when \[ they pulled the troops out of , \+ uh , or they reduced the number of troops in \] Europe after the Berlin Wall went down *T*-1
55416:60	back up \] what it 's saying *T*-3
55423:25	guess 0 what
55442:65	is when I 'm on the bike *T*-2
55459:18	figured how *-1 to get that soft *T*-2
55476:26	's what *T*-1 's my biggest problem with * going to \[ a place , \+ uh , \[ a , \+ a \] health club
55499:24	do what you want *T*-1
55503:11	's what
55526:34	is what they call it *T*-1
55634:28	's your choice where you want *-2 to go *T*-3
55644:32	go to Texins at all when you were working for T I *T*-1
55650:18	'm very limited what I do *T*-1
55698:55	watching what I ate *T*-3
55740:17	's like when I got laid off *-1 *T*-2 , E_S I went back in there , and start all over again because it had been a while since I 'd done it
55766:46	do what they did *T*-2
55775:58	go into the hot tub *T*-1 before I go *-2 swimming , or when I come out *T*-3
55775:88	'm totally relaxed when I go home *T*-4
55787:29	watching how well I can walk up and down stairs *T*-2
55790:52	wanted \] *-1 to get one of those steppers when I bought the bike *T*-2
55821:35	see what you feel 0 *T*-1 is best for you
55828:41	depends , you know , for everyone their own what they want *-1 to do *T*-2
55864:45	know if , you know , I was eighteen or whatever , I 'd want *-1 to be stuck *-2 doing it for a year or whatever
55864:93	know if , you know , I was eighteen or whatever , I 'd want *-1 to be stuck *-2 doing it for a year or whatever
55874:19	know \] how old you are *T*-1
55880:47	see that many of them had conscientious objections to war or whatever
55881:176	felt strongly then that even if they did n't feel like they could kill someone , or go into a military situation , that they could help the country in other ways . Be it * cleaning out , uh , lots , \[ in , \+ in \] their neighborhood or , whatever kind of community or public service *T*-2 might be available
55900:35	guess 0 it would still depend on how
55901:154	is what you do *T*-2
55916:34	imagine what kind of , uh , uh , bureaucracies *ICH*-2 we 'd get into *T*-1 and expense *-3 having it be full time
55956:63	being most beneficial if it 's in \[ the neighborhood where \+ or , or at least the area where \] the person lives *T*-1
55956:87	being most beneficial if it 's in \[ the neighborhood where \+ or , or at least the area where \] the person lives *T*-1
55961:60	do something *ICH*-4 up there that I 'll never be able *-2 to see *T*-3 again
55972:154	figuring out how *-4 to do the logistics , of it *T*-5
55990:78	being that different . But even more beneficial because it would be something that everybody participated in *T*-1 , and would take a turn in *T*-1
56012:60	know 0 you 've got *-1 to get past \[ that , \+ that \] grudge attitude that many have *T*-2
56059:28	seen , when we were traveling around the state *T*-1 , some similar signs *ICH*-2 up that *T*-3 indicated that certain sections were being policed and cleaned up *-4
56059:69	seen , when we were traveling around the state *T*-1 , some similar signs *ICH*-2 up that *T*-3 indicated that certain sections were being policed and cleaned up *-4
56104:94	see that , you know , uh , we go from one side to the other on just about any subject , that \[ you , \+ one \] might care *-1 to bring *T*-2 up
56148:56	knows what he 's doing *T*-1
56155:13	's why they *ICH*-2 're there *T*-1 and not me

57631:30	was n't what I really needed *T*-1
57635:18	was the van that I needed *T*-1 then , *-2 to buy the , you know
57646:11	's what I like *T*-1 because , they 've got plenty of power
57651:63	made a major mistake , years ago when they stopped *-2 putting the small V eights in and went to the fours and some of the sixes *T*-3
57669:43	think 0 \[ that little , \+ the little \] Chevy V eight when it started out \[ in sixty , \+ in fifty-five , \] I think *T*-1 was two sixty-five , something like that

57871:133	guess 0 I see such a contrast like as opposed to the Middle East War 0 we just had *T*-1 , where President Bush went out and got worldwide support \[ for , \+ for \] what *T*-2 was happening *T*-3
57890:28	's why we had it this time *T*-1

57897:47	was 0 they were opposed to the folks that *T*-3 were there *-4 fighting it
57906:51	think 0 \[ it , \+ it 's \] one of those things that you learn *T*-1 the hard way
57920:127	think that \[ the , \+ the \] time difference between the two wars has allowed a lot of people to see the mistakes that *T*-1 were made *-2 \[ \[ in , \+ in , \] \+ in \] every aspect of it
57935:42	get them out of Kuwait , which he did *T*-2
57943:42	think 0 him going in and doing that would be putting us in another Vietnam situation

57971:17	did \[ what , \+ what \] he said *T*-1
57971:25	did \[ what , \+ what \] he said *T*-1
57972:45	got any further than that \[ where , \+ where \] it would have turned into more of a police action . Uh , or more of a political action I guess , *T*-2 you getting into their governmental affairs which you really ca n't do *T*-1 \[ as , \+ as \] another country

57980:34	have so many problems *ICH*-2 here at home that we do n't address *T*-1
57988:42	's \] what *T*-1 frustrates me more than anything
57999:189	think 0 *T*-2 we could take care of everything . And quit *-3 taking care of all these other countries all across the world , you know , who *T*-4 just end up *-5 using things against us later on anyway
58006:35	think that maybe a lot of the Arab countries that *T*-1 were so hateful towards the United States have come away with , uh , kind of a different attitude
58049:67	know what they were there for *T*-1
58068:19	remember when it was over *T*-1
58069:11	remember when they were coming home *T*-1
58081:24	believe that the way that it was done *-1 *T*-2 and the way 0 that was handled *-3 *T*-4 were right
58081:56	believe that the way that it was done *-1 *T*-2 and the way 0 that was handled *-3 *T*-4 were right
58101:71	says because you 're supporting the troops that \[ you 're , \+ you 're \] supporting the war
58126:35	recall when President Bush said that *T*-1 , you know
58146:21	know what they 're doing *T*-1 for themselves . You know
58168:37	's where we as American people really \[ failed , \+ you know , failed \] them *T*-1
58179:29	think 0 this is the first time that I have n't been cut *-1 off by the computer *T*-2
58185:26	is something *ICH*-1 to me that *T*-2 's sad
58217:71	being what it is *T*-1
58239:26	's what *T*-1 hung people up the most
58248:128	is that we tried *-1 to convert everything from inches to centimeters * preserving basically the inches but expressing them as centimeters rather than * saying no , a centimeter is about the width of your thumbnail , or whatever , \[ and , \+ you know , and \] leaving it at that
58256:77	think 0 the real problem with \[ this , \+ this \] weird conversion , \[ yo- , \+ you \] see signs that *T*-1 say fifty-five miles per hour and , you know , whatever it would be *T*-2 one hundred six kilometers per hour , you know
58256:115	think 0 the real problem with \[ this , \+ this \] weird conversion , \[ yo- , \+ you \] see signs that *T*-1 say fifty-five miles per hour and , you know , whatever it would be *T*-2 one hundred six kilometers per hour , you know
58277:16	know why they \[ we- , \+ um , were \] more able than we were *?* *T*-1
58323:21	's what I was thinking *T*-1 by quick transition
58488:49	say , 0 * makes a difference in what you eat *T*-2
58496:36	eat what we , \[ w- , \+ \] eat *T*-2
58529:21	guess 0 the thing that *T*-1 always turned out the best for us was something 0 we thought 0 *T*-2 looked really fancy but was real easy
58551:19	remember what the recipe 's name is *T*-1 anymore
58580:32	went to this dinner party *ICH*-2 the other night that *T*-1 was kind of like a game
58592:26	decide what can we serve *T*-2 because at this one the hostess was pretty busy *-3 running around trying *-4 to get stuff ready for the table
58594:50	thinking 0 there 's this Beef Bourguignonne recipe that I 've tried *T*-1 before that *T*-2 's pretty good
58594:70	thinking 0 there 's this Beef Bourguignonne recipe that I 've tried *T*-1 before that *T*-2 's pretty good
58645:18	know what * to do *T*-1
58757:32	have this pie crust recipe *ICH*-1 in our family that my grandmother gave my mother *T*-2
58758:18	taught me how * to make it *T*-1

58815:13	's how they continue the thing *T*-1
58821:16	know how safe that was *T*-1
58871:11	's where practically everybody 0 I talked to *T*-1 is from *T*-2
58876:21	's why they call me because they want *-1 to get people outside the state *T*-2
58882:11	's where we went *T*-1
58911:56	talking how he 's thinking of *-1 leaving the company and going to Dallas *T*-2
58912:11	saying how
58979:115	decided for you how many you can really have *T*-2 and make it
58989:44	was real lucky because my husband had a good enough job where \[ when my kids were , \+ you know , when I had them *T*-1 and when they were small *T*-2 , \] until \[ they got in junior high school , \+ my youngest got in junior high , \] I did n't have *-3 to work *T*-4

59038:40	know where it would come from *T*-1
59077:18	said my goodness , what is it , lined *-1 in gold , you know , uh
59082:52	see how *T*-2 we could have made it , you know , without me working *T*-1
59098:39	getting more and more like , when you have one child *T*-1 now , that 's it
59116:66	think 0 I 'm just part of \[ tha- , \+ the \] new stuff , that *T*-1 is just

59151:15	know 0 when my mother 's age it was always the kids and the family and everything 0 *T*-2 had *-1 to come first
59176:18	imagine why we would want *-1 to have children *T*-2
59197:21	's what it is *T*-1
59200:30	thought , oh , my gosh , what *T*-1 is the matter with her , you know
59212:41	was kind of odd because as a general rule the people that *T*-1 married during my time , they had kids within a year
59218:39	travel and stuff like that , which we did *T*-2
59222:16	care what anybody tells you *T*-1
59228:35	says that , you know , maybe when she 's thirty *T*-1 she might want a child then
59235:101	take care of us when it 's our time *T*-1

59286:44	stay home with my kids , which I really wanted *-2 to do *T*-3
59298:34	think 0 it 's just the new way that people are thinking *T*-1
59305:85	be neat \[ if , \+ if \] they could incorporate into small and large businesses both a built in day cares where the children were there in the facility but not necessarily right there with you *T*-1

59336:63	say that there are a couple of arguments against , uh , strong gun control which I find *T*-1 very compelling , although most the people who *T*-2 argue gun control with me I find , uh , 0 *T*-3 use sort of canned arguments , you know , sort of the N R A slogan arguments

59649:79	putting too many , uh , people *ICH*-1 in jail that *T*-2 probably do n't need *-3 to be there

60892:30	's \] where Stillwater is *T*-1 or , sweet
60925:31	's not like it was a big ranch where they let the cow roam around *-1 free *T*-2

60946:68	said that they 've got a real problem that , um , you 've got toxins \[ and , \+ and , \] uh , bacteria in the manure that *T*-1 is *T*-2
60953:11	forget what that 's called *-2 *T*-1 with , you know
61012:47	said \[ that , \+ that \] what they were doing *T*-1 was * scraping it with bulldozers and stuff , and taking it to , uh , these like ponds that they had *T*-2 0 * to filter it with *T*-3

61044:213	going *-3 to be a problem for , um , \[ just \[ the , \+ the \] Earth , \+ you know , what the Earth \] is receiving *T*-4 back , you know , because how can you tell where it 's going *-5 to come down at *T*-6 *T*-7
61044:253	going *-3 to be a problem for , um , \[ just \[ the , \+ the \] Earth , \+ you know , what the Earth \] is receiving *T*-4 back , you know , because how can you tell where it 's going *-5 to come down at *T*-6 *T*-7
61044:266	tell where it 's going *-5 to come down at *T*-6 *T*-7
61072:22	do because , what is it *T*-1 , carbon dioxide , they use that where we ca n't synthesize it
61072:53	use that where we ca n't synthesize it
61086:30	think 0 there 's lots \[ that *T*-1 be , \+ that *T*-2 could be \] done *-3 * \[ to , \+ to \] improve how things are done *-4 now *T*-5

61086:94	improve how things are done *-4 now *T*-5
61159:11	's why it *EXP*-2 really surprises me , you know , that he has n't come back , because , like I said , he 's never gone away like this before *T*-1
61247:11	's what *T*-1 are so neat about animals
61258:17	care what you look like *T*-1 , or what you act like *T*-2
61258:38	care what you look like *T*-1 , or what you act like *T*-2

61444:40	's very \] affectionate when he wants *-1 to be *?* *T*-2
61475:34	know exactly how * to get that attention *T*-1 , you know
61500:11	's why we could n't understand why he would want *-2 to get out *T*-3 , you know , because he 's had all this room 0 * to run in *T*-1 *T*-4
61500:27	understand why he would want *-2 to get out *T*-3 , you know , because he 's had all this room 0 * to run in *T*-1 *T*-4
61547:36	understand why he kept *-1 wanting *-1 to get out *T*-2
61551:34	see what *T*-2 's going on
61572:21	's what *T*-1 really bothers me the most about it
61613:51	was our cat *ICH*-2 's name \[ \[ that , \+ that , \] \+ that \] *T*-1 died

61623:20	were really into that when we got him *T*-1 * going to the Ranger games
61706:57	's so many software packages available *ICH*-2 today . That *T*-1 just require no programming
61712:56	understanding how the computer works *T*-1
61746:16	remember how they started out *-1 running three , four hundred dollars *T*-2
61820:118	find the monitors \] forty dollars and the card that *T*-1 drives the monitor that *T*-2 goes in the back of the board for twenty-five dollars which *T*-3 is amazing to me
61827:38	's probably a half a dozen companies *ICH*-2 around the world that *T*-1 are making those mother boards , the main computer , the circuit board
61897:22	is where a computer is very handy *T*-1
61962:18	know how much *ICH*-1 I know *T*-2 about this subject
62004:62	know , that like if you have college notes , if you teach in a lower income bracket where they do n't pay as much *T*-1 and they cancel part of your , you know , your college note or whatever
62004:127	know , that like if you have college notes , if you teach in a lower income bracket where they do n't pay as much *T*-1 and they cancel part of your , you know , your college note or whatever
62024:30	know that also one of my cousins who , uh , *T*-1 he is in like the therapy type thing
62033:113	think 0 that 's a good way \[ for people to , \+ you know , maybe get people to \] come back to these small towns *-3 to work by *-4 helping people that *T*-1 normally might not be able *-2 to go to college and get the type of degree 0 they want *T*-5
62039:99	's \] beneficial to the small towns too because , they \[ really , \+ really \] \[ have , \+ have \] a disadvantage that we would n't understand *T*-1 because we 're in the Metroplex
62072:48	teach them how * to do things like * farm , uh , dig their own wells , set up , their schools *T*-2
62097:39	think 0 it was one of Kennedy 's hot points that he
62100:69	given *-1 to them that they want *T*-3
62100:89	see what it 's like *T*-6 if you do n't have all the money and ca n't have what you want *T*-5 when you want it *T*-7
62100:139	have what you want *T*-5 when you want it *T*-7
62100:153	have what you want *T*-5 when you want it *T*-7
62138:16	is why this has died out *T*-1
62152:136	know 0 there are races of people that *T*-1 are dropping out
62160:21	are people *ICH*-3 now that *T*-1 are obsolete point and fact \[ just , \+ just \] like endangered species of animals , so there are quote tribes of people , that *T*-2 are endangered or obsolete
62160:103	are people *ICH*-3 now that *T*-1 are obsolete point and fact \[ just , \+ just \] like endangered species of animals , so there are quote tribes of people , that *T*-2 are endangered or obsolete
62166:19	remember what it was *T*-1
62167:86	winnowed *-2 because \[ they 're , \+ \] where they are *T*-1 they 're not adapted to their environment essentially
62198:67	talking about all these people that *T*-1 are n't even in our own country when there 's enough people here that I think 0 *T*-2 probably need help and , could be helped *-3 *T*-4
62198:87	talking about all these people that *T*-1 are n't even in our own country when there 's enough people here that I think 0 *T*-2 probably need help and , could be helped *-3 *T*-4
62232:31	's what my father-in-law was talking about *T*-2
62250:48	learn how * to support themselves *T*-1 *T*-2
62283:14	's exactly what I was going *-1 to ask you *T*-2
62329:37	tell what I 'm doing *T*-2
62368:11	explained what we needed *T*-1
62387:13	is what it 's called *-1 *T*-2
62415:42	is that you ca n't put the type of card that we need *T*-1 to put in it , in it . And even though they told us in advance that you could *?*
62425:19	know what they were talking about *T*-1
62459:60	blocking where we need *-1 to do it *T*-2
62474:68	not knowing what *T*-1 goes on
62531:35	put the kind of clout *ICH*-1 on them that you ca n't really do *T*-2
62575:19	know which brand it is *T*-1
62658:67	had Toyotas *ICH*-3 for years that *T*-2 have had almost no repair work 0 * to do *T*-4 on them
62698:64	do what I want *-1 to do *T*-2 , and , MUMBLEx on
62705:32	's a shame too because , uh , when you get right down to it *T*-1 most things , \[ there is n't any , \+ \] if you do a good job , nobody can pay you enough
62726:26	underestimate \[ how much , \+ how much \] value the satisfaction N_S is *T*-1
62726:37	underestimate \[ how much , \+ how much \] value the satisfaction N_S is *T*-1
62780:38	tell you 0 when I \[ do \+ do \] it on a regular basis *T*-1 I feel so much better and so much healthier
62814:11	know what you mean *T*-1
62912:35	is that my friend that *T*-1 was taking with me the first two months was n't *?* the second two months
62922:16	makes a difference when you have somebody 0 * to go with *T*-1 and 0 *T*-2 to do the same the same thing *T*-3
62931:16	know what the name of it is *T*-1 anymore
62947:16	hate it when I 'm doing it *T*-1
62997:19	enjoy it when I 'm doing it *T*-1
63019:19	's amazing how much better I feel *T*-1
63057:33	have more energy when I exercise *T*-1
63061:16	know why I do n't do more *T*-1
63131:26	see how you work *T*-2
63176:47	have some , uh , \[ aerobic , \+ uh , water aerobics \] when the weather gets nice *T*-1 out in the pool
63224:48	think 0 the aerobics classes are even pretty reasonably priced *-2 , from what I 've heard *T*-1
63250:97	is the problem , because we 're so wound up \[ in the \+ in the \] system that we 've got *T*-1 that , you know , * trying *-2 to convert over
63254:54	guess , \[ what 'd they try *T*-1 , \+ 0 they tried \] what 'd the call it *T*-2 , soft conversion and hard conversion

69965:49	were used to , what , uh , gulf coast weather was like *T*-1 , when we came here to Pacific coast weather *T*-2
69982:43	see what all the Pacific coast is like *T*-1
70020:60	see what it 's like *T*-3
70054:26	hearing how things are going *T*-1 in Texas
70139:26	seems like everyone that *T*-1 lives around us , ends up , you know , *-3 hearing every conversation that *T*-2 goes on outside with everyone
70139:76	seems like everyone that *T*-1 lives around us , ends up , you know , *-3 hearing every conversation that *T*-2 goes on outside with everyone
70208:30	seeing how tall the grass has gotten *T*-1
70250:66	come to a house like that *ICH*-2 now that *T*-1 's just , you know , a very square little box
70397:13	enjoy where they 're living *T*-1
70407:24	says , why did you let him play in the dirt *T*-1
70422:27	was a big dirt eater , supposedly , when I was a child *T*-1
70430:16	's what I 've always
70469:14	Tell me how yours works *T*-1
70474:41	introduced you a little bit to it , a few minutes ago , when I said that \[ we are , \+ uh , we 're \] on the east coast now *T*-1
70517:60	decide \[ wh- , \+ how \] we had been *-2 spending our money before *T*-3
70522:52	adjusted , where we could come down *T*-1 and where we did n't want *-2 to come down *T*-3
70522:74	adjusted , where we could come down *T*-1 and where we did n't want *-2 to come down *T*-3
70547:41	work when our , uh , you know
70571:35	did that for about two years , which *T*-1 worked real well , and then moved from California where we realized 0 we could never buy a house anyway no matter how much we saved *T*-2 *T*-6 , and moved to Texas , bought a house *ICH*-5 immediately , you know , which *T*-3 , of course , is now devalued *-4 with the housing market
70571:109	realized 0 we could never buy a house anyway no matter how much we saved *T*-2 *T*-6
70571:170	bought a house *ICH*-5 immediately , you know , which *T*-3 , of course , is now devalued *-4 with the housing market
70599:34	seems like there 's , um , times when we just have *-1 to get out *T*-3 where we 'll go and like get a baby-sitter and we 'll go and we 'll blow , you know , fifty , sixty dollars in one night * going out *-2 to eat , going to a show or doing something *T*-4 , you know
70599:64	seems like there 's , um , times when we just have *-1 to get out *T*-3 where we 'll go and like get a baby-sitter and we 'll go and we 'll blow , you know , fifty , sixty dollars in one night * going out *-2 to eat , going to a show or doing something *T*-4 , you know
70605:22	's the hard part because when we sit down *-1 to make it *T*-2 , we try *-3 to make it real spartan and real narrow so we can put a certain amount in savings every week
70615:113	is that it 's really , um , you know , budgeting and some extra things , you know , \[ for- , \+ \] that *T*-1 are more , you know , nonessential items
70617:83	was not where we were concerned *-5 *T*-2 , but where maybe our friends *ICH*-1 were concerned *-4 and our relatives and parents *T*-3
70617:107	was not where we were concerned *-5 *T*-2 , but where maybe our friends *ICH*-1 were concerned *-4 and our relatives and parents *T*-3
70681:11	's what my husband said *T*-1
70700:11	's what you should do *T*-1
70704:18	do n't , when it 's just taking *-2 out of the paycheck and stuff *T*-1
70711:67	reading an article *ICH*-1 in , uh , a North Carolina \[ pap- , \+ paper \] today where a high school student obtained over two hundred thousand dollars worth of scholarships for herself by *-3 sitting up at night and typing at , uh , letters of applications to universities *T*-2
70750:88	agree with you on that . Because everybody has a different idea of where the money should go *T*-1
70773:68	imagine \[ \[ that , \+ that , \] \+ that \] \[ what the , \+ what the \] problem
70773:80	imagine \[ \[ that , \+ that , \] \+ that \] \[ what the , \+ what the \] problem
70774:286	is that this , uh , \[ rather , uh , quick \[ and , \+ and \] easy , \+ I do n't know , I should n't say easy , rather quick \] victory \[ in the , \+ \[ in , \+ in \] the , \] uh , Mideast , uh , uh , over the , uh , Iraqis , uh , might lead us into , uh , a false sense *ICH*-1 of security that we can do that against any other foe
70775:50	know what other foe that would be *T*-1
70784:68	is , like , 0 they had eleven thousand HARM missiles which T I is the sole supplier for *T*-2
70793:106	imagine that , that would be * to keep it at \[ a level , \+ those levels , \] I guess , \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-1 were originally appropriated *-2 \[ \[ w- , \+ was \] \+ \] when the Soviet threat , I guess , was perceived *-4 as *-4 being a greater one *T*-3

70793:165	appropriated *-2 \[ \[ w- , \+ was \] \+ \] when the Soviet threat , I guess , was perceived *-4 as *-4 being a greater one *T*-3
70801:36	know \[ what amount of , \+ what amount of , \] our hardware *T*-1 would stop some fanatic , I guess , from *-2 doing anything , uh , that *T*-3 would be irrational
70801:50	know \[ what amount of , \+ what amount of , \] our hardware *T*-1 would stop some fanatic , I guess , from *-2 doing anything , uh , that *T*-3 would be irrational
70801:117	know \[ what amount of , \+ what amount of , \] our hardware *T*-1 would stop some fanatic , I guess , from *-2 doing anything , uh , that *T*-3 would be irrational
70837:11	see where the infrastructure *ICH*-1 is sort of breaking down , the roads , the highways *T*-2
70844:50	guess 0 I 'm not associated with what ghetto schools , \[ \[ and , \+ and , \] \+ uh , and , \] uh , rural school systems are like *T*-1
70902:11	see what you 're saying *T*-1
70920:37	care what it takes *T*-1 * to qualify , \[ whether you 're , uh , \[ an , \+ an \] ex- , \+ whether you 're a veteran \] or whether you
70923:52	guess 0 the enactment of that form of legislation , would give many people who ,
70941:16	know what that would be *T*-1
71040:28	had one even when we have n't had big yard *T*-1 because , um , we enjoy that
71093:42	was just that I happened *-1 to organize this group , that *T*-2 was about seventy people
71112:61	doing what I can do *T*-1 on my own
71119:40	think that most women 's garden clubs that I 've been aware of *T*-1 in the past , uh , are only flowers
71128:31	's the men 's garden clubs that I would have wanted *-1 to join *T*-2
71139:45	are n't men 's gardening clubs *ICH*-2 in this area that I know of *T*-1
71176:19	tell me what *T*-1 's in your garden this year , since I do n't have one
71186:31	discovered that , uh , impatiens that tried and true *ICH*-3 \[ is , \+ \] turns out *-2 to be about the best thing 0 * to use *T*-1 there along with coleus . Because they , uh , look pretty \[ and , \+ \] in my front garden , uh
71238:17	pick them when they 're very young and have very little string *T*-1
71239:16	picks them when they 're fat *T*-1
71316:23	's why I enjoy gardening *T*-1 , because , you know , * growing up with it
71356:24	's what they use *T*-1 for gypsy moth
71366:96	sprays , \] um , \[ t- , \+ \] two , three times in the spring when the , uh , caterpillars \[ are , \+ are \] coming along *T*-2
71466:15	guess 0 what I do *T*-1 now is I play softball , right now
71555:25	guess 0 the job that I 'm in *T*-1 it *EXP*-2 's stuff * to stay on any kind of a regular schedule
71644:46	think 0 the last time 0 I was on a bike *T*-1 when I was about twelve *T*-2
71647:47	forgot how * to ride a bike *T*-1
71650:16	forget how * to ride a bike *T*-2
71699:56	have \[ those , \+ uh , those \] exercise bands *ICH*-4 *ICH*-5 now that *T*-1 are better that you can use *T*-2 for like toning instead of *-3 using a weight
71699:70	have \[ those , \+ uh , those \] exercise bands *ICH*-4 *ICH*-5 now that *T*-1 are better that you can use *T*-2 for like toning instead of *-3 using a weight
71724:43	denotes \[ how much they , \+ how much the tension \] I guess they are *T*-4 and how easy *ICH*-3 they are *T*-1 0 * to move *T*-2 *T*-5
71724:57	denotes \[ how much they , \+ how much the tension \] I guess they are *T*-4 and how easy *ICH*-3 they are *T*-1 0 * to move *T*-2 *T*-5
71724:91	denotes \[ how much they , \+ how much the tension \] I guess they are *T*-4 and how easy *ICH*-3 they are *T*-1 0 * to move *T*-2 *T*-5
71735:59	think , uh , 0 with the aerobic classes you have *-1 to get an instructor that *T*-2 's fun
71736:87	enjoying \] what she 's doing *T*-2
71736:139	get out , uh , what they should get *T*-3 out of the class
71768:54	know how *-2 to isolate each of the different muscle groups , with those things *T*-1
71788:20	hear what this machine is telling you *T*-1
71803:30	's \] where I 'm really starting *-1 to get noticeable *T*-2
71814:94	stopped *-2 playing , which *T*-1 was about four years ago
71870:38	feel guilty when you eat that cake after dinner *T*-1
71907:32	work at all when I was growing up *T*-1
71934:69	seems that there 's \] a grass roots , um , effort or whatever going on
71988:31	think 0 it would be women that *T*-1 were working full-time
71991:70	are real busy when they are home *T*-2
72026:42	have *T*-1 when they do n't have a real good family structure *T*-2
72086:35	taught *-1 how * to be responsible *T*-2
72095:27	be responsible when
72099:29	called * the boomerang kids where they move out for a while *T*-1 N_S and they come back
72270:71	read a book a month *ICH*-4 this year which *T*-1 is like about eleven more books than I would have read *T*-2 last year
72280:41	's what \[ I , \+ I \] do *T*-1
72338:34	enjoy what I 'm reading *T*-1
72348:11	's why
72350:40	'm \] kind of a nut when it comes to stuff like that *T*-1
72355:16	know what you would call it *T*-1
72366:11	know what you mean *T*-1
72387:44	read *T*-1 that *T*-2 is along those lines , that *T*-3 was really good
72387:65	read *T*-1 that *T*-2 is along those lines , that *T*-3 was really good
72398:13	know who it was about *T*-1
72415:36	's like up to you , in other words , whatever *T*-1 happens in your life
72517:12	's what I liked *T*-1 , too
72600:49	was , how do you feel that this influences family *T*-1
72605:13	know how * to use them in your life or to influence *T*-1
72628:23	read . Uh , where a lot of people do n't have any interest in it at all *T*-1
72637:22	's really surprising how many people *ICH*-2 *T*-1 graduate from high school , \[ and \+ \] that I work with *T*-3
72657:23	's why reading is so important *T*-1
72661:30	think 0 even mentally when you can do some
72664:71	got our first , uh , credit card , oh , back in the \[ seventies , \+ early seventies \] when , I first got married *T*-1
72750:67	guess for that very reason \[ that , \+ that , \] uh , if you 're not real conscious of what you 're doing *T*-1 , it 's just too much by the time 0 you get
72769:45	know 0 if you do n't , then they 're adding on , what , eighteen , nineteen , twenty percent
72822:71	use it however you want *-2 to *?* *T*-3
72840:18	knows how many people , *T*-2 are looking at those , uh , bills that *T*-1 come in , and those statements
72840:55	knows how many people , *T*-2 are looking at those , uh , bills that *T*-1 come in , and those statements
72852:56	see what it is that you are buying *T*-1
72926:112	kept a minimum balance in any kind of account whether it was a savings account or what it was *T*-1
72990:25	seems like , uh , even when they have consulted day care centers that *T*-1 are quote unquote reputable , that *T*-2 are sort of like a chain , if I can use that word *T*-4 uh , still you have *-3 to deal with the people that , you know , *T*-5 happen *-6 to be operating it locally
72990:47	seems like , uh , even when they have consulted day care centers that *T*-1 are quote unquote reputable , that *T*-2 are sort of like a chain , if I can use that word *T*-4 uh , still you have *-3 to deal with the people that , you know , *T*-5 happen *-6 to be operating it locally

73049:23	see where someone , you know , in a position like that , in a live-in capacity , would definitely be the way 0 * to go *T*-1 if \[ you 're , \+ you 're \] lucky enough *-3 to have the financial MUMBLEx 0 * to be able *-2 to do that *T*-4 *T*-5
73059:70	's \] a terrible thing 0 * to say *T*-2 when you 're speaking of children in that way *T*-1
73075:53	's so much pressure when you 're talking about two people that *T*-1 work outside the home *T*-2
73075:76	's so much pressure when you 're talking about two people that *T*-1 work outside the home *T*-2
73076:43	think 0 that is one reason why I continue *-1 to be without children *T*-2
73129:114	imagine how emotional it must be *T*-3
73133:19	were lucky when our children were that age *T*-1
73191:21	know what *T*-1 happens after they get in school
73312:33	'm sort of at a loss where that 's concerned *-1 *T*-2
73368:24	know what *T*-1 happened
73372:108	tied * in a chair . Where obviously she \[ had , \+ had , \]
73508:17	guess , 0 when I was growing up *T*-1 , \[ it was , \+ it *EXP*-2 was \] still the ideal * to \[ get a , \+ get a \] home and buy house
73558:47	hope 0 it happens , because I 'd be one of those that *T*-1 gets caught *-2
73635:37	's what *T*-1 makes him happy
73643:48	guess 0 that 's about how long
73773:35	see why children do drop out *T*-1
73780:88	going where I wanted *-1 to go *T*-2
73802:37	is when we had the Washington riots *T*-1
73823:50	have *-2 to go over to Patterson when those riots were going on , \[ at \+ \] sometimes *T*-3
73846:56	was \] what you got *T*-2
73849:11	's what
73873:127	is that , uh , we have taken some rather drastic turns \[ in our , \+ in our \] education and the way 0 we approach things *T*-1 as of maybe starting back \[ when , \+ when \] I 'm number one , you know , and , uh , uh , uh , * worrying about self and not , uh , seeing the consequences of the disintegration of the family *T*-2
73873:135	is that , uh , we have taken some rather drastic turns \[ in our , \+ in our \] education and the way 0 we approach things *T*-1 as of maybe starting back \[ when , \+ when \] I 'm number one , you know , and , uh , uh , uh , * worrying about self and not , uh , seeing the consequences of the disintegration of the family *T*-2
73883:136	turn to *T*-2 , \[ when you got , \+ when you 've got \] something facing you like that *T*-3
73883:151	turn to *T*-2 , \[ when you got , \+ when you 've got \] something facing you like that *T*-3
73904:21	see exactly , why the child is that way *T*-1
73919:46	make up in a classroom of one hour a day , what *T*-1 's not been done *-2 for , fifteen or sixteen years at home
73952:60	working on the family farm which *T*-1 was a traditional American way
73970:13	worry when , you know \[ these \+ the \] sex and drugs on the young children and the unborn children
73984:44	is \] almost overwhelming sometimes when you think , \[ of , \+ of \] the jobs that *T*-1 is out there *-2 to be done *-3 , in order * to flip things back around *-6 the way 0 they needed *-4 to be *T*-5 *T*-7
73984:81	is \] almost overwhelming sometimes when you think , \[ of , \+ of \] the jobs that *T*-1 is out there *-2 to be done *-3 , in order * to flip things back around *-6 the way 0 they needed *-4 to be *T*-5 *T*-7
74018:40	drive I think 0 *T*-3 when I was , um , a teenager *T*-2
74035:61	going to work \[ when their child , \+ when their children \] are little *T*-1
74035:75	going to work \[ when their child , \+ when their children \] are little *T*-1
74037:102	was when they were teenagers *T*-4
74043:11	's why I 'm working in a school system so that I 'm home when they 're home *T*-1 *T*-2
74043:50	'm home when they 're home *T*-1
74048:26	are there when they need you *T*-1
74056:85	is very helpful because it lets me be a little more tolerant and understanding of what people do *T*-1
74076:25	'm home at three o clock when the children are at home E_S or where home *T*-1
74093:112	looked a long time before she found one that *T*-2 was laid back enough so \[ they \+ she \] would be able *-4 to interact with them
74108:26	realize how important it is *T*-1
74168:49	think 0 a lot of it has *-1 to do with the fact that we do n't train our teachers very well
74196:108	think 0 I would start \[ with a -bout , \+ with \] *-3 getting rid *-4 of about two-thirds of the administrators . And all the auxiliary personnel . The school bureaucracy that *T*-1 exists *-2 mainly to perpetuate itself
74211:36	see what *T*-2 works
74271:98	is that if you just raise salaries across the board , you 're going *-2 to be , uh , rewarding people who *T*-3 've been doing a lousy job . \[ And \+ \] instead of getting the , uh , improvement that we want *T*-4

74315:59	was that some college kid who *T*-1 might not be all that bright * to begin with , was thrown *-7 into a class room with a teacher who *T*-4 was harried and overworked and , uh , had too many kids 0 * to handle *T*-5 and too many things 0 * to do *T*-6 and too many interruptions * to pay much attention to the student teacher

74334:188	Figure out what *T*-5 worked and what *T*-6 did n't work
74346:31	happens that the teacher is an instructor who *T*-2 is in New York while Jimmy 's in Rome
74357:139	learn how * to learn *T*-3 *T*-4
74360:163	is that we have such a fragmented system for , uh , curriculums that the textbook makers produce a textbook that *T*-2 will sell in Texas and California

74364:20	's where the two biggest markets are *T*-1
74389:92	take what Texas gets *T*-1
74514:11	's what I want *-1 to do *T*-2
74554:11	know what you 're saying *T*-1 there
74560:32	have windows in our bathrooms which *T*-1 really makes it difficult for
74583:85	put new ones *ICH*-6 in that *T*-4 are easier 0 * to clean *T*-5
74678:16	know where it 's going *-1 to flood *T*-2
74716:16	know what he was doing *T*-1
74748:25	had squirrels in our attic when we first moved in *T*-1 because the roof was so sorry
74763:29	's a law that you 're only allowed *-2 to have three layers of shingles
74768:16	know what it is *T*-1 off hand
74772:28	know what he was doing *T*-1
74915:63	're really glad *ICH*-2 with all the rain 0 we 've had *T*-1 in the last couple of years that we have a really good roof
74941:19	is what
74947:103	find out what kinds of computers *T*-3 might be useful
74963:61	seen that just in the last , uh , even five years *ICH*-2 how much they 've \[ in- , \+ uh , increased \] in use *T*-1 . Or probably eight years
75019:38	watch a T V program when it 's on *T*-1
75024:26	watch it when it 's convenient *T*-1
75054:73	remember how *T*-2 kids would walk around with A M , what do you call those *T*-3 , little A M radios *T*-4
75054:105	remember how *T*-2 kids would walk around with A M , what do you call those *T*-3 , little A M radios *T*-4
75077:61	find out what they wanted you for *T*-3 and who you were supposed *-4 to call *T*-5
75077:83	find out what they wanted you for *T*-3 and who you were supposed *-4 to call *T*-5
75114:30	know what *T*-1 caused it
75146:63	guess 0 we \[ 're \+ were \] just beginning *-1 to get into what they were calling *T*-2 \[ the , \+ uh , the \] sex revolution \[ where , \+ \] uh after the pill
75146:111	guess 0 we \[ 're \+ were \] just beginning *-1 to get into what they were calling *T*-2 \[ the , \+ uh , the \] sex revolution \[ where , \+ \] uh after the pill
75151:51	guess 0 in the seventies is \[ the , \+ the \] time when that was supposed *-1 to have exploded *T*-2
75151:55	guess 0 in the seventies is \[ the , \+ the \] time when that was supposed *-1 to have exploded *T*-2
75155:71	think 0 that 's caused a lot of pressure *ICH*-1 on , like younger kids today , * to make choices that they probably should n't have *-2 to make *T*-3
75166:74	know that the expectation for them was , uh , * to have sex and , much earlier , than the expectation when I was in college *T*-1
75188:19	's kind of scary when I think of what *T*-2 will happen in twenty years , you know , when I have kids and they 're grown *T*-3 and , uh , just kind of some of the changes that *T*-1 will happen even more *T*-4

75191:67	predict what *T*-1 's going *-2 to happen in twenty years
75198:46	tell you what , uh , my kids were likely *-2 to be like *T*-3
75221:115	's so much easier * to get hold of people and get quick answers to things . Even when they 're on another continent *T*-3
75251:30	been abroad when they were still in high school *T*-1
75254:25	's \[ what , \+ uh , what \] my family was talking *T*-1 when I picked up and moved to Texas from Indiana *T*-2
75254:38	's \[ what , \+ uh , what \] my family was talking *T*-1 when I picked up and moved to Texas from Indiana *T*-2
75254:60	talking *T*-1 when I picked up and moved to Texas from Indiana *T*-2
75390:55	think 0 they could , uh , definitely add to the police force and the type equipment that they use *T*-1
75408:15	is how do you convince people not to commit such crimes in the first place *T*-1
75419:15	think 0 what they need *-1 to do *T*-2 is * stop *-3 building more jails and start *-3 giving stiffer sentences , uh
75526:40	released *-1 , you know , several times , which *T*-2 is another , uh , deal 0 I hate *-3 to see *T*-4
75570:25	waited for them , where they 've robbed , you know , particular neighborhood *T*-1
75616:39	say 0 probably eighty percent of them that *T*-1 are caught *-2 , they 're from places like up in Oklahoma , and Louisiana , Arkansas , you know , across \[ the , \+ the \] border
75634:92	do *T*-1 \[ when they , \+ when they \] catch these people *T*-2
75634:104	do *T*-1 \[ when they , \+ when they \] catch these people *T*-2
75641:22	think , uh , 0 what I would like *-1 to see *T*-2 is , number one , * completely getting rid *-3 of these victimless crimes
75642:92	's no reason 0 * to enforce those and spend time and money *-2 doing it \[ and , \+ and \] worry about these things *T*-1 where people are getting hurt *-4 *T*-5
75646:31	think 0 one of the big things that you can do *T*-1 \[ is , \+ *-2 to increase deterrence is , \] uh , if someone is found *-3 guilty of a , uh , felony level offense , they lose their citizenship
75660:26	tell me what you 've been doing *T*-2 lately in the
75684:18	was amazing what I found out 0 I could do *T*-1 on my own if I just put my mind to it
75694:86	do something to a basic ranch , style home . Uh , after *-2 having a one that *T*-3 was historical looking
75717:37	's \] really why we ended up in a house like this *T*-1
75718:18	is not \[ what we , \+ you know , what we \] want *-1 to stay in *T*-2 forever , because \[ I have *-3 to have my , \+ I 've found that after *-4 doing this other house , I have *-5 to have my \] hands into stuff
75718:40	is not \[ what we , \+ you know , what we \] want *-1 to stay in *T*-2 forever , because \[ I have *-3 to have my , \+ I 've found that after *-4 doing this other house , I have *-5 to have my \] hands into stuff
75730:24	is , uh , 0 when we moved in *T*-1 they had just , uh , painted , \[ wallpa- , \+ we 're , you know , wallpapered
75733:46	see \] how much longer we 're here *T*-1
75795:35	think 0 some of the things that I did *T*-1 paid off
75828:11	's where I need *-1 to go *T*-2
75987:80	says 0 we 're going *-1 to have \[ a par- , \+ a barbecue \] and tell everybody , * guess what
76029:23	know what they 're finally going *-1 to do *T*-2
76035:77	ask him what they are *T*-2
76069:52	telling him , is n't there something \[ that , \+ that \] you can bring *T*-1 home with you that *T*-2 kills everything that you spray *T*-3 , you know , \[ out in the , \+ out in the \] field , that you can get rid *-5 of , these bugs
76069:60	telling him , is n't there something \[ that , \+ that \] you can bring *T*-1 home with you that *T*-2 kills everything that you spray *T*-3 , you know , \[ out in the , \+ out in the \] field , that you can get rid *-5 of , these bugs

76100:60	heard \[ the , \+ \] what the subject was *T*-1 *T*-2
76173:35	seen *-1 more so because when you call parents up *T*-2 , many parents wo n't even recognize that there is a problem
76192:82	informed *-2 better , that in fact that the problems that *T*-1 are nationwide are problems , um , of society , and \[ that , \+ that \] the school can only do so much on it
76214:15	know 0 what *T*-1 scares me too , is that we have yet *-2 to see \[ other , \+ \] the biggest effect of the crack children uh , in the school system
76222:37	happen when these kids start *-4 coming into the school system *T*-3
76227:55	think 0 there are \] a couple of areas where the school system can improve *T*-1
76289:29	remember 0 I had a college professor who *T*-1 once said that genius is one percent inspiration , and ninety-nine percent perspiration
76294:35	know that there were a lot of kids that *T*-1 were an awful lot smarter than me
76298:19	proved out late when it came time 0 * to take the S A T -s *T*-1 *T*-2
76375:16	resent when you ask them . Is there a problem that we should be aware of *T*-1 *T*-2
76375:44	ask them . Is there a problem that we should be aware of *T*-1 *T*-2
76425:40	say at what point is n't the help becoming negative *T*-2
76429:23	is where the school system \[ at , \+ \] is suffering , and not through any fault of the effort of the school system *T*-1
76448:18	's amazing how the , you know , people 0 you talk to *T*-1 have some interesting conversations *T*-2
76475:22	go to estate sales , which *T*-1 takes up a lot of time
76687:32	told me , uh , what sports that you are active in *T*-1
76687:37	told me , uh , what sports that you are active in *T*-1
76802:22	know where it is *T*-1 , or have been there
76819:45	's a lot of , uh , old time wealth *ICH*-1 there that , *T*-3 has helped *-2 to stabilize things
76943:11	's what I hope *T*-1
76954:47	think that it 's getting to where they 're not spending time together *T*-1
76976:49	know \] what you mean *T*-1
76978:87	find time 0 *-5 to spend *T*-2 together when you both work full time and , uh , you both have hobbies that *T*-3 are different *T*-4
76978:132	find time 0 *-5 to spend *T*-2 together when you both work full time and , uh , you both have hobbies that *T*-3 are different *T*-4
77003:130	said that they would probably choose careers \[ that *T*-3 are more , \+ um , where they could manage \] their own schedule E_S and , uh , they could spend more time with their kids *T*-2
77003:154	said that they would probably choose careers \[ that *T*-3 are more , \+ um , where they could manage \] their own schedule E_S and , uh , they could spend more time with their kids *T*-2
77052:33	choose *-1 to *?* , which *T*-2 is fine
77094:48	think that , um , uh , \[ most , \+ most \] kids that I see *T*-1 \[ do n't really , \+ they do n't really \] value quality time
77118:42	realize what a luxury it was *T*-1 \] at the time
77149:44	do a lot of things *ICH*-1 with their kids that they would n't ordinarily be able *-2 to do *T*-3 if they were working
77186:55	know what day care is really all about *T*-1 because \[ I , \+ I \] never went to a day care center
77193:29	being around when we were little *T*-1
77235:50	did *T*-2 with your children when they were growing up *T*-3
77270:18	started *-1 swimming when they were , oh , seven and eight *T*-2
77283:43	drive up *-1 to see that \[ \[ when \+ w- , \] \+ whenever \] it was reasonably close *T*-2

77283:60	drive up *-1 to see that \[ \[ when \+ w- , \] \+ whenever \] it was reasonably close *T*-2
77333:42	pattern our vacations where we would travel and do things *T*-2 , and that there would be \[ a , \+ a \] feature each day . Whether it would be * going to
77359:26	started *-1 working half-time when , uh , they were at the nursery school *T*-2
77366:38	started *-1 working part-time when they were in , um , junior high school and high school *T*-2
77374:33	need me more *ICH*-2 , when they were older *T*-1 , than they did when they were
77374:62	did when they were
77407:45	talked about it , \[ to \+ \] how important it was *T*-1 when I came home from school *T*-2

77448:38	felt , gee , if I were n't here , how
77462:102	been \] interesting \[ and \+ \] particularly \[ I , \+ I \] think because the society in which we live *T*-1 , families are separated
77529:110	suffering a little bit , in that , uh , \[ \[ the model , \+ the role models \] that *T*-2 get \+ \[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ the \] family issues that *T*-1 get \] discussed *T*-1 , and all these , I think 0 *T*-3 are very important parts of them growing up

77544:50	is what a family is like *T*-1
77567:71	realize what it was *T*-1
77601:48	did when \[ they gave them to , \+ she gave them to \] us *T*-2
77612:72	put a little gift *ICH*-3 \[ if I see something that *T*-1 's , \+ \] uh , occasionally a Christmas tree decoration which they will save *T*-2 for \[ their , \+ their \] future *T*-4
77620:57	put a dollar bill for each day . Which *T*-2 was the equivalent
77630:55	passed *-1 on to them \[ when they , \+ when they \] get married *-2 and leave *T*-3
77630:67	passed *-1 on to them \[ when they , \+ when they \] get married *-2 and leave *T*-3
77635:19	saying what other trends are there *T*-1
77671:95	studying this in our school , that , um , this is one of the symptoms , or not the symptoms , E_S it 's one of the ways that young girls feel that they are maturing *T*-1
77751:25	noticed that one thing \[ that , \+ that \] T I did *T*-2
77751:33	noticed that one thing \[ that , \+ that \] T I did *T*-2
77783:27	found that \] when \[ I , \+ I \] do n't have cable television anymore , uh , when I moved , went back to graduate school *T*-2 I just did n't have the money 0 * to \[ buy , ge- , \+ rent \] a cable T V line , or whatever *T*-1 , you know

77803:34	have it available out there where we are *T*-1
77804:56	's \] what we usually watched *T*-2
77815:45	do what else you wanted *-1 to do *T*-2
77906:52	is \[ a , \+ uh , uh , an \] international city , where Baltimore is hometown Baltimore
77918:104	was in China , \[ le- , \+ \] two years ago when all that was going on \[ in , \+ in , \] uh , Beijing *T*-3
77928:69	bother with the Washington station because \[ I just , \+ \] it 's so far removed from what I 'm interested in *T*-1
77955:76	do a nice job , uh , for Washington , you know , which *T*-1 is
77970:18	remember where the other one lives *T*-1
78002:16	know what the situation is *T*-1
78035:82	become very aware of different political views because some of the things 0 we have *-1 to discuss *T*-2 are very politically motivated or whatever
78037:43	's \] so funny 0 when you live in one part of the country *T*-2 you only see that perspective
78066:43	travelled all over Europe . \[ When I was , \+ when I was \] very young *T*-1
78066:58	travelled all over Europe . \[ When I was , \+ when I was \] very young *T*-1
78199:30	did quite a bit of hiking , E_S which *T*-1 is kind of fun
78233:64	planning a vacation , when you \[ have , \+ have \] children *T*-2
78259:52	know that , uh , uh , \[ one of , \+ one \] thing that *T*-1 happens \[ to us \+ to \] vacation trips now is that usually that try to involve some of the members of the family
78259:99	is that usually that try to involve some of the members of the family
78260:21	go wherever somebody *ICH*-2 is *T*-1 , that we have n't seen *T*-3 for a while
78260:41	is *T*-1 , that we have n't seen *T*-3 for a while
78279:27	had a reunion *ICH*-1 last year that *T*-2 was kind of like that , too
78292:58	guess 0 my favorite vacation idea would be * to somehow figure out something kind of mobile where you could stop and sleep *T*-1 maybe , you know , like \[ a , \+ a \] small camper
78375:64	took a trip , uh , around to the , uh , Civil War battle grounds and things back in nineteen sixty when it was the centennial or something *T*-1
78499:50	think 0 back in the \[ ei- , \+ times \] when , uh , my political opinions were being formed *-1 *T*-2 like \[ in Viet- , \+ during the Vietnam \] war and stuff , the Republicans were more , you know , what they called *T*-3 Hawks , which *T*-4 is more like aggressive in war and more pro war , and pro aggression
78499:146	were more , you know , what they called *T*-3 Hawks , which *T*-4 is more like aggressive in war and more pro war , and pro aggression
78499:167	were more , you know , what they called *T*-3 Hawks , which *T*-4 is more like aggressive in war and more pro war , and pro aggression
78569:13	's what they need *T*-1
78576:69	find out , you know , what *T*-1 's going on
78577:13	know what I mean *T*-1
78582:68	know what *T*-1 would have been wrong with
78583:19	remember who *T*-1 ran for president against Bush
78617:16	's what I mean *T*-1
78618:19	know what the difference between Dukakis and Bush was *T*-1
78632:58	do , you know , whatever *T*-2 is best for their campaign anyway
78637:11	's what I mean *T*-1
78655:21	seems like the stuff that they put *T*-1 out now , it , I mean , \[ I , \+ \] does n't just seem like it
78656:48	know for a fact that \[ the , \+ any \] kind of stuff that if you , wrote and asked for material
78660:21	say , well what do you want me to believe *T*-1
78664:47	tell where they 're standing on certain issues *T*-2
78668:11	know how they do it *T*-1
78678:20	's kind of , how I judge *T*-1
78683:22	show \[ wha- , \+ how \] they voted *T*-1 in the past
78683:30	show \[ wha- , \+ how \] they voted *T*-1 in the past
78692:19	put out what *T*-1 makes them look good anyway
78774:56	feel like they have *-1 to vote the way that their husbands vote *T*-2
78806:65	think 0 that was right , because he may have been a good president , or whatever
78821:39	go by their , uh , personal life when they vote *T*-1
78858:13	know what I mean *T*-1
78869:30	think 0 \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] having a big effect on how poorly that the country is being run *-1 *T*-5 , is that , um , \[ \[ the , \+ the election , \] \+ the people that *T*-2 want *-3 to get elected *-4 \] are turning it into a popularity contest by *-6 advertising the things \[ that , \+ you know , that \] *T*-7 really do n't have anything 0 *T*-8 to do with how well they do the job *T*-9

78874:56	vote for them that *T*-2 would n't have *?* if they had come down on the wrong side
78875:13	know what I 'm saying *T*-1

78894:60	think 0 he won from Carter because of \[ the , \+ um , the \] hostages that *T*-1 were held *-2 at that time
78932:13	know what he 's doing *T*-1

78994:13	's what \[ I , \+ I \] do n't understand *T*-2 exactly why they do n't have that option *T*-1

79001:26	had some bends *ICH*-1 , around that we could find and put them in *T*-2
79010:88	going where we will actually have , uh , a bend that we put things in *T*-2 for * recycling these other things *T*-4
79010:119	going where we will actually have , uh , a bend that we put things in *T*-2 for * recycling these other things *T*-4
79019:32	think 0 it 's a marvelous idea \[ when you think of , \+ uh , when I just think of \] the papers that I dump *T*-1 out *T*-2

86360:46	guess 0 I relate it \[ to , \+ to \] Japan where things are very expensive *T*-1 , are n't they *?* *T*-1
86427:20	hunting when I was twelve years old *T*-2
86438:26	think 0 \[ the \+ \] what was National Rifle Association , uh , had this bumper sticker *ICH*-1 a few years back \[ if , \+ uh , about 0 if \] you outlaw guns , E_S only outlaws will have guns then
86442:29	believe that too because the person that *T*-2 is wanting *-1 to , commit a crime is going *-3 to find a way 0 * to get \[ \[ a gum , \+ a gu- , \] \+ a gun , \] a knife , \[ a , \+ a \] rock , a stick , whatever it is *T*-4 , 0 * to commit a crime with *T*-5 *T*-6

86936:57	put everybody *ICH*-2 in jail that *T*-3 commits a crime

87694:28	start your public transportation when you started your cities *T*-2

88355:14	's probably where you 've used it *T*-1
88363:20	's what they have *T*-1 there
88370:11	's what I 've heard *T*-1
88393:45	does a lot of things too that \[ if you , \+ if you \] do any kind of , uh , research or anything like that where you have *-1 to , uh , use footnotes *T*-2 , it is just wonderful . Because it keeps track of all your footnotes

88496:36	teach her how * to type * using the computer *T*-2
88578:37	guess 0 you have not reached the stage where you need *-1 to , uh , promote a college or anything *T*-2 , huh

88939:16	see what I please *T*-1
88982:37	know what his name is *T*-1
88984:26	know who you are talking about *T*-1 though
89031:37	's quite a few , uh , movies out *ICH*-4 now that I would like *-1 to go *-2 see *T*-3
89039:37	is why we do n't go *T*-1
89076:26	was WARLOCK *ICH*-5 too , which *T*-1 is supposed *-2 to be the story of a , uh , witch hunt that *T*-3 is , you know , magically shot *-4 into the present time
89076:74	was WARLOCK *ICH*-5 too , which *T*-1 is supposed *-2 to be the story of a , uh , witch hunt that *T*-3 is , you know , magically shot *-4 into the present time
89136:42	understand 0 that 's a sequel to an earlier movie that *T*-1 showed about two weeks ago on television
89201:47	had a turn at the end , when you found out who it was *T*-1 *T*-2
89201:61	found out who it was *T*-1 *T*-2
89316:27	give it two years back , when it was , I think 0 *T*-2 , bottomed out *T*-1
89345:23	ask or scream *T*-1 when I 'm on the phone *T*-2
89358:26	say how long that will last *T*-2 too
89371:40	built *-1 by the architect *ICH*-3 *ICH*-6 for himself , who *T*-2 never moved into it . Who *T*-4 sold it to a couple who *T*-5 had no idea that homes ever needed upkeep

89399:53	know that this one was built *-1 for two ninety nine , which *T*-2 is nowhere near what we paid *T*-3 for it
89399:69	is nowhere near what we paid *T*-3 for it
89442:18	's pretty much what it was built *-1 for *T*-2
89444:90	be a long time , if ever , when nice things and really quality construction and all the other additional amenities are really , uh , desirable *T*-2
89462:14	are huge when you are inside them *T*-1
89480:52	thought 0 that was important instead of * getting swallowed up in something that you know
89547:109	is probably about what their equity *ICH*-6 is *T*-3 , that they got *T*-4 out of *-5 selling their house
89547:131	is *T*-3 , that they got *T*-4 out of *-5 selling their house
89566:40	know why your God damn bill is so high *T*-1
89688:29	is what *T*-1 is scary
89689:27	's where some of the bad images of nursing homes come from *T*-1
89689:69	Is when people have *-2 to put people in a nursing homes *T*-3
89694:49	took my husband one night to an emergency room when he was in an emergency situation *T*-1

89730:46	took two pair *ICH*-2 over yesterday for him that *T*-1 were clean
89785:67	is so sad because it just takes all the dignity away \[ from , \+ from \] people who *T*-1 have been independent all their lives
89799:36	know what the answer is *T*-1
89834:34	guess 0 there was not a name for what she had *T*-1 at that time
89905:35	understand what *T*-2 is going on
89921:97	wrote *T*-3 who *T*-2 was , uh , a research librarian
89984:13	is , what I have been reading *T*-1
90024:11	is when it really got big *T*-1
90050:11	is what I have heard *T*-1
90059:33	is so perceptive , when it comes to , you know , * pinpointing , uh , \[ \[ so- , \+ so- , \] \+ society 's \] ills and , things like that and just nailing people to the wall and exposing things *T*-1
90074:87	tell me what *-2 to do *T*-3 with my garden

90360:18	do whatever they want *T*-1
90381:18	have a problem when they compare the kids in Japan or Germany to the kids here *T*-1
90388:52	had cases *ICH*-1 in the past where parents have committed suicide because their child has not gotten into the top kindergarten , which *T*-2 means 0 they probably wo n't get into the top elementary \[ and , \+ and \] high school *T*-3

90425:37	feel like my children , who *T*-1 are kind of middle of the road , \[ have , \+ are \] more rounded , you know
90440:16	's why I said , 0 their childhood is extremely different from mine *T*-1
90496:16	's where the family grew *T*-1
90627:50	think 0 they feel \[ the , \+ the \] closeness that they *T*-3 used *-4 to be there . Which *T*-2 is a shame

90631:16	's just how it is *T*-1
90798:29	think 0 that 's one reason why I 'm part of this study *T*-1 , uh , because \[ it 's of , \+ \] I 'm working with voice systems
90811:34	is , 0 when you 're a kid *T*-2

90819:139	know what I want *T*-1
90824:33	decide what *T*-2 is important about the school

95595:90	be smart if somebody would keep , uh , some sort of a plan that *T*-1 works for them

95819:37	figure that that is an investment that *T*-1 is , uh , really \[ a in- , \+ invaluable
95833:30	think that that 's the way that we looked at it *T*-1 in our beginnings when my husband was in graduate school *T*-2 that there was a light at the end of that tunnel .

96214:38	changed that you have noticed *T*-1 ? During your time there
96219:41	guess 0 there 's more women in , uh , what *T*-1 would be classified *-2 as a man 's job
96268:23	was a math major , which *T*-1 was a real rarity , among women at that time
96301:56	think that , uh , you know , the one thing that I have seen *T*-1 is that more and more women are getting into management
96309:33	was something on T V *ICH*-2 the other day that *T*-1 said that fewer than one or two percent of the \[ \[ heads of , uh , \+ chairmen of the board , \] \+ \[ chair- , \+ chair persons , \] uh , \[ if you sa- , \+ if you will , \] of the board \] are women in this country
96326:53	think 0 we have come a long way , actually , when I think about , you know , when things were like even , \[ when I , \+ you know , just when I \] was in high school *T*-4 *T*-3 , and how it is *T*-1 now for girls *T*-2
96326:80	think 0 we have come a long way , actually , when I think about , you know , when things were like even , \[ when I , \+ you know , just when I \] was in high school *T*-4 *T*-3 , and how it is *T*-1 now for girls *T*-2

96403:88	see it \[ \[ in , \+ uh , also in , \] \+ uh , like in \] church , uh , where more and more women are becoming ministers . \[ In , \+ uh , you know , in \] protestant congregations *T*-1
96410:66	know if you are Roman Catholic or , you know , what *ICH*-2 you know *T*-1 about that

96779:58	do what I want *-2 to do *T*-3
96852:53	developing diseases *ICH*-3 now that *T*-1 used *-2 to be predominately male diseases

96883:40	know what the healing process would be *T*-2 or what *T*-1 was causing the problem
96937:19	's how society has changed *T*-1 , uh , you know , uh
96984:53	think that that 's one of the things that women are sacrificing *T*-1 that they should not do *T*-2
97001:17	finding out who you are *T*-1
97003:34	do *T*-1 when you are working full time and have *-2 to come home and prepare a meal and , get homework done *-3 *T*-4
97014:37	be there only when they came to me and asked me for help *T*-2
97050:16	know how *-1 to think for themselves and be responsible , for themselves *T*-2
97054:16	know why God made women brilliant *T*-1
97069:61	talking to a friend *ICH*-2 yesterday , who *T*-1 said 0 she has a new policy in her home
97101:42	think 0 that 's one of the things that we have *T*-1 today that *T*-2 is very useful

97124:43	work around \] children when you work *T*-1
97208:25	does \[ when , \+ when \] they are real little *T*-1
97208:33	does \[ when , \+ when \] they are real little *T*-1
97235:39	think that , you know , when there 's two year olds running around *T*-1 , \[ the , \+ \[ whoever *T*-2 is taking care of , \+ the care givers \] \] are going *-3 to pay attention to the two year olds
97235:85	think that , you know , when there 's two year olds running around *T*-1 , \[ the , \+ \[ whoever *T*-2 is taking care of , \+ the care givers \] \] are going *-3 to pay attention to the two year olds
97309:73	think \] 0 child care for infants is much harder than when they are older *T*-1
97320:24	's when they are clinging to mama *T*-1
97325:55	hurts the parents * to leave when the child is crying *T*-2
97332:39	see how things work out *T*-3
97356:14	's nice when , uh
97360:31	were where I could not get my hands on them *T*-1
97417:22	be a little rough when she is a very , very little infant *T*-1
97427:64	do it on a trade off basis . That I watch , their baby when they want *-2 to go out to dinner or to movies or whatever *T*-4 , or if she wants an afternoon off . Even if she wants an afternoon 0 * just to work . Uh , and not be bothered *T*-5
97427:82	watch , their baby when they want *-2 to go out to dinner or to movies or whatever *T*-4
97427:123	watch , their baby when they want *-2 to go out to dinner or to movies or whatever *T*-4
97445:32	see how things work out *T*-2
97446:106	have the , day care centers there , whether it 's the parents who *T*-1 take turns *-2 watching the kids , or whether
97460:75	set *-1 up so that \[ you , \+ when you \] go *T*-2 you can be assured that if there 's an emergency that person in charge knows C P R or first aid
97508:43	divorced *-1 in nineteen , uh , fifty-seven , when I was seven years old *T*-2
97556:34	think that there are people \[ that , \+ I think that , \] uh
97657:82	think that , uh , in the long term that women are going *-1 to be able *-3 to have the recognition that they deserve *T*-2
97668:35	are a lot of die-hards *ICH*-2 out there that *T*-1 will never change
97674:34	figure out why they can not ever change *T*-1 , why they can not bend *T*-3 . I mean , why they can not just accept , you know , competent women *T*-4
97674:58	figure out why they can not ever change *T*-1 , why they can not bend *T*-3 . I mean , why they can not just accept , you know , competent women *T*-4

97706:67	is what we are discussing *T*-2
97754:41	are more comfortable when somebody is the boss *T*-2
97757:51	guess 0 we would have *-1 to go back to the way that the Lord made us *T*-2
97769:56	think that they should be in harmony with what they are *T*-1 , with what the subject matter is *T*-2
97769:75	think that they should be in harmony with what they are *T*-1 , with what the subject matter is *T*-2
97812:29	think 0 there are some people that *T*-1 have done that
97875:36	rented one *ICH*-3 recently that *T*-2 seemed *-1 to go on forever
97877:24	seems *-1 to happen when you rent them *T*-2 , you know
98034:67	looks like he 's the one that *T*-1 wound up *-2 killing her *T*-3
98219:30	tell them what *T*-2 's right and what *T*-3 's wrong
98219:46	tell them what *T*-2 's right and what *T*-3 's wrong
98256:32	think 0 they definitely have more problems \[ that , \+ \] uh , \[ in , \+ in \] the area
98268:13	's which *T*-1 came first
98277:169	thought 0 , you know , crime \[ was , \+ was \] reasonably unknown and just the situation that *T*-3 's developed *-4 with \[ the , \+ the \] drug aspect of , uh uh , the pushers , the dealers and the addicts , uh
98298:49	think , you know , that there is a lot in the society where things have changed *T*-1
98305:263	legalize drugs . Because it would eliminate \[ the , \+ uh , the \] violence and \[ \[ \[ the , \+ uh , the under- , \] \+ the , \] \+ the market , \] I guess 0 *T*-3 , \[ the , \+ the \] hidden market of the drugs and everything that *T*-2 goes along with it
98361:103	see if when you make them available *T*-2 people then do n't use them
98417:70	see , 0 unfortunately , we have this whole mentality that somehow there are these pots of money out there that you can sue somebody and , you know , there 's a million dollars 0 you can have *T*-1 uh , for mental duress or whatever *T*-2 *T*-3
98417:150	see , 0 unfortunately , we have this whole mentality that somehow there are these pots of money out there that you can sue somebody and , you know , there 's a million dollars 0 you can have *T*-1 uh , for mental duress or whatever *T*-2 *T*-3
98436:74	understand how * to handle it as a society to say \[ okay , \+ it is okay \] under these circumstances , but if you step outside these bounds , the punishment is extreme *T*-2
98448:29	hit *-1 by a drunk driver when I was in high school *T*-2
98483:20	shows how our attitude toward drinking and driving was , uh , misplaced *-1 for years *T*-2
98513:125	have real problems when it comes to , uh , uh *T*-1
98522:41	think 0 the jury should be the ones \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-1 put the \[ sense- , \+ sentencings \] down
98522:49	think 0 the jury should be the ones \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-1 put the \[ sense- , \+ sentencings \] down
98524:128	Not knowing , you know , exactly what things are *T*-1 , \[ from , \+ from \] murder on up to like tax stuff
98559:92	put a \[ \[ sen- , \+ sen- , \] \+ sentencing \] *ICH*-5 *ICH*-2 down that *T*-1 was , uh , longer , you know , that \[ did n't fit , \+ the punishment did n't fit \] the crime *T*-3

98568:82	get somebody *ICH*-5 *ICH*-6 in there \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-2 has a name , that *T*-3 is the defendant and , you know , sometimes , might have more pull

98574:41	paid *-2 off \[ or \+ \] politically or whatever the case may be *T*-1
98581:123	is that often in the newspaper , \[ I , \+ I \] tend *-3 to hear two things \[ that , \+ well , that \] *T*-2 go on
98581:136	is that often in the newspaper , \[ I , \+ I \] tend *-3 to hear two things \[ that , \+ well , that \] *T*-2 go on
98593:18	know what *T*-1 is really going on , what *T*-2 is , uh , really the range of sentences or awards that *T*-3 \[ are , \+ uh , are \] actually , uh , in the end applied *-4

98599:67	is when you have \[ like a , \+ say a \] rapist , come in *T*-2
98600:98	reduced *-1 because he 's gone to a lesser charge , like , I do n't know what , assault or something or
98611:56	put on *-2 like , they were the ones that *T*-1 caused it or whatever
98611:71	put on *-2 like , they were the ones that *T*-1 caused it or whatever
98614:65	think 0 that 's right because all 's 0 that 's going *-1 to do *T*-2 is * say , Oh , well , you know , that was a breeze
98621:16	's where , uh , the role of juries \[ is , \+ is \] restricted *-1 *T*-2
98623:59	is , 0 it 's restricted *-1 in the sense that , juries only decide the charges that *T*-2 are actually , uh , brought *-3 , you know
98638:11	's what information *T*-1 is presented *-2
98640:50	hear only a fraction \[ of the , \+ of the \] story when they have *-1 to decide guilt or innocence *T*-2
98650:55	is , uh , as I say , when I 've heard about , you know *T*-3
98666:19	look very different when you hear different parts \[ of the , \+ of the \] truth *T*-1
98671:43	did it , just for your train of thought where \[ they , \+ they \] showed something *T*-1
98733:49	notice when you go to different schools *T*-2 that some are a little more fancier than others and have a very casual , uh
98764:28	know that , though sometimes when you 're going in *T*-1
98848:138	say , you know , what , have you got a job interview today
98858:33	know how a coach *ICH*-4 would feel \[ if , \+ \] that *T*-1 teaches health or \[ Eng- , \+ you know , English , \] or whatever *T*-3 that they had *-2 to wear a tie
98858:68	feel \[ if , \+ \] that *T*-1 teaches health or \[ Eng- , \+ you know , English , \] or whatever *T*-3 that they had *-2 to wear a tie

98886:21	's what I would think *T*-1
98890:11	's what I would think *T*-1
98920:18	's the parochial schools that I guess many ti-
98944:30	say , then why * bother *T*-2
98945:21	wear what I want *T*-1
99012:27	retiring in South Carolina when I graduated *T*-1
99065:57	know what a big university is like *T*-2
99074:39	thought 0 this would expose both of them to what it 's , you know , like *T*-1 on a \[ coll- , \+ a smaller college \] campus
99158:13	's how , you know , my decision was made *-1 *T*-2
99169:72	have children *ICH*-4 there who *T*-3 just love it
99182:21	's what he 'd like *-1 to do *T*-2
99188:15	know what she 'd like *-1 to do *T*-2
99204:77	showing them 0 if you 're strong in math and science , kiddos , this is one area where women can make some decent money *T*-1 . You know
99218:57	sounds like he 's got some really , you know , good strong ideas of what he wants *-1 to do *T*-2
99260:27	rain which *T*-2 seems strange * to have it raining in July
99264:63	have too much , uh , humidity \[ or , \+ or , \] uh , rainy time when it 's past June *T*-1
99270:29	get those great big cracks in the ground where it 's been so dry *T*-1
99289:34	forget how much it did rain *T*-1
99311:19	do whatever you wanted *-1 to do *T*-2
99325:14	know where that is *T*-1 because I know where Pontiac is *T*-2
99325:38	know where Pontiac is *T*-2
99357:20	's how it worked out *T*-1
99403:72	is the only one 0 I have real memories of *T*-1 . Which *T*-2 is
99545:55	go down \[ the hi- , \+ the hill \] on the sleds when it 's icy *T*-1
99553:40	think 0 we must be the only people on the block that *T*-1 make use of that cold weather and get out there
99587:46	started , uh , a bin program *ICH*-1 here in Plano where , uh
99640:15	's how she started *T*-1
99672:19	's amazing how much plastic you generate *T*-1
99681:62	help *-1 supplement it , you know when they turned them in *T*-2
99685:22	's amazing how many cans you go through *T*-1 . And how fast they accumulate *T*-2
99685:47	's amazing how many cans you go through *T*-1 . And how fast they accumulate *T*-2
99696:27	know 0 our neighbors , when we first went to this bin program *T*-1 said , oh , there 's no way , you know 0 we 're going *-2 to have *-3 to have pickup twice a week *T*-4
99802:56	is \] when they show the dump sites you know , \[ and , \+ and , \] how big they are *T*-2 *T*-3
99802:103	is \] when they show the dump sites you know , \[ and , \+ and , \] how big they are *T*-2 *T*-3
99875:60	take the newspaper * to begin with . When , neither one of us are home *-1 \[ t- , \+ to \] read it *T*-2
99959:22	live down in College Station where , his parents do too *T*-1
99980:74	lose \] memory sometimes \[ and , \+ which \] *T*-2 is kind of frightening when she 's in the car *T*-3
99980:96	is kind of frightening when she 's in the car *T*-3
100018:40	think 0 they 're adequately caring for themselves when they 're really not eating \[ very much \+ or very balanced \] meals *T*-1
100082:60	know the type of facilities whether it 's a shared room or two separate rooms that *T*-1 share uh , a , uh , bathroom
100106:15	know 0 when my friend 's mother-in-law first went in *T*-1

100160:33	know that it 's just going *-1 to be downhill from then on
100161:47	fight it that *T*-2 desperately needed *-3 to make the change
100166:22	's probably what *T*-1 's going *-2 to happen with my husband 's mother
100176:35	think , \] what do you have *T*-1 there
100193:19	understand why they , so much want *-1 to just stay in that building *T*-2
100214:18	going , why do n't you want *-1 to be close to me and your other family *T*-2
100252:39	know what *T*-2 's going on
100286:55	know if that would make a difference in how you felt *T*-1
100298:56	realize what this country 's all about *T*-1
100301:49	guess 0 \[ that 's MUMBLEx , my , \+ that 's something that my \] family has always believed strongly in *T*-1
100326:48	think 0 that 's probably like , uh , quite a few things \[ that , \+ that \] the kids , uh , maybe not so much nowadays but used *-1 to go through *T*-2 , you know
100326:56	think 0 that 's probably like , uh , quite a few things \[ that , \+ that \] the kids , uh , maybe not so much nowadays but used *-1 to go through *T*-2 , you know

100376:33	live in Richardson *ICH*-2 right now . Which *T*-1 is just
100429:31	know how young you 'd have *-2 to go *T*-1
100448:25	think that *T*-1 has been lost *-2 in families
100458:71	realize what a small percentage of the world that is *T*-1
100543:69	're not a lot of problems where I teach *T*-1
100548:91	know how many of her students *T*-3 would show up
100561:48	being able *-2 to do much of anything when they do n't even come to school *T*-3
100593:35	be a survival thing for the family , which you can understand *T*-1
100613:153	is n't really what *T*-3 's wrong with the \[ public , \+ public \] schools
100614:11	's what *T*-1 's wrong with families
100619:11	's what *T*-1 's wrong with families
100627:16	know what * to expect *T*-1 at home
100629:16	know what *T*-1 's going *-2 to happen just out front of their apartment complex
100663:63	's when kids are , you know , at a tougher and rougher age and all that *T*-1
100695:72	hope 0 they have the flexibility * to be able *-1 to change a child that *T*-2 really is in need of counseling help if they absolutely refuse *-3 to work with them
100740:30	was , what *T*-1 happens when public education fails *T*-2
100740:41	happens when public education fails *T*-2
100749:31	think , uh , 0 one thing that we 'll see *T*-1 is that we wo n't be educating everybody
100780:66	is that they will graduate every child \[ that , \+ uh , that \] *T*-1 is here in the ninth grade
100780:79	is that they will graduate every child \[ that , \+ uh , that \] *T*-1 is here in the ninth grade
100811:49	guess 0 we 're both lucky . *-2 To be in situations and schools where we do n't see that *T*-1
100826:19	see you when we see you *T*-1
100856:14	started back when it *EXP*-2 was n't , stylish * to do that at all *T*-1
100861:37	worked even when she was a baby *T*-2
100919:23	was a nightmare back when Cheryl was little *T*-1
100929:42	is that the people that *T*-2 were there when Cheryl was two *T*-4 , which *T*-3 was fifteen years ago , many of them are still there today
100929:56	were there when Cheryl was two *T*-4 , which *T*-3 was fifteen years ago
100929:76	was two *T*-4 , which *T*-3 was fifteen years ago
100935:32	changed her diapers when she was three *T*-2
100940:29	was because they had a director that *T*-1 had always done it as a labor of love
101059:35	was neat because she was like the grandmother that my kids never had *T*-1 because both our parents are dead
101070:29	was a neighborhood friend that *T*-1 kept her
101112:34	did when \[ I , \+ \] my kids were born *-1 *T*-3
101122:25	've , you know , whatever schedule they want *T*-1 from a pay standpoint
101139:50	see how effective they are *T*-1
101157:47	think 0 it 's an area that *T*-1 needs *-2 to be looked at *-3 and improved *-3 because more of us are going *-4 to have *-5 to work
101164:50	is supposedly why the government makes the decisions 0 they do *T*-1 *T*-2
101164:117	think , you know , 0 since big business is supposedly why the government makes the decisions 0 they do *T*-1 *T*-2 you know , \[ the , \+ the \] people that *T*-3 work in big business have families
101182:50	gave *T*-1 when they were giving us information about our Employee Assistance Programs *T*-5
101182:85	was the rationale 0 they gave *T*-1 when they were giving us information about our Employee Assistance Programs *T*-5 that they want us to be happy and want us to be able *-2 to cope with *-3 trying *-4 to split ourselves in fifteen million pieces
101204:135	take their children to *T*-2 when they 're young *T*-3 until they hit the preschool age
101221:13	is what I found *T*-1 with Emily

108562:18	's a good reference when you need *-1 to dig something up *T*-2

108701:28	were very frustrating when they were little *T*-1 in terms of their tastes
108829:83	think 0 that would be one thing 0 I would definitely consider *T*-1 * try *-6 to find a school within the state that , um , I liked *T*-3 well enough *-2 to attend
108849:32	give you financial aid , where another one wo n't *?* *T*-1
108854:47	was wonderful , because I got one of those grants that you do n't have *-1 to repay *T*-2

109185:67	sustain what their life-style is *T*-1

109850:35	hear what the topic was *T*-1
109881:38	mean , that there 's a lot more people *ICH*-2 that *T*-1 stay home now than before
109882:76	think 0 maybe people were just kind of wanting *-1 to have the choice of what they could do *T*-2
109915:61	am fortunate because I do n't know a real lot of moms that *T*-1 get *-2 to stay home
109916:84	's just \] weird that I was just talking to somebody *ICH*-3 this morning \[ who *T*-1 's , \+ who *T*-2 's \] \[ a working , uh , lady , \+ a working mom

109922:46	seems like everybody 's always so busy with everything that they 're doing *T*-1 that there 's no time for this and that and the other

109926:67	feel bad that *T*-2 have *-3 to work , too , * saying , you know , 0 you should stay home , you know , otherwise your children are n't going *-4 to , you know , turn out , or whatever
109926:189	saying , you know , 0 you should stay home , you know , otherwise your children are n't going *-4 to , you know , turn out , or whatever
109926:234	hate for them to make people *ICH*-1 feel bad that *T*-2 have *-3 to work , too , * saying , you know , 0 you should stay home , you know , otherwise your children are n't going *-4 to , you know , turn out , or whatever because that 's not fair to , you know , like the single moms that *T*-5 have *-6 to work
109938:35	find that \[ \[ I , \+ whenever I have *-1 to , \] \+ whenever I 'm \] in a group of people *T*-2 and we 're discussing things *T*-2

109947:140	talk about *T*-1 , uh , where career and things like that were concerned *T*-2
109957:11	's what I figure *T*-1
109964:67	noticed that there are \[ a lot of , \+ uh , a lot more \] people that *T*-1 are more comfortable , at least , with some women being home \[ and , \+ \] at least in the circles 0 I 've travelled *T*-2 and in the church that I go to *T*-3 , you know

109978:15	found 0 when I did do some work *T*-1 when my son was young *T*-2 , it was like contract work
109978:37	found 0 when I did do some work *T*-1 when my son was young *T*-2 , it was like contract work
109979:15	was n't where I had *-1 to be there every day *T*-2
109981:20	know how you could have a full time job and ever have any vacation time 0 * to do anything besides * go to the doctor *T*-1 *T*-2
109985:14	see where that would definitely hinder the problem *T*-1
110002:45	have box turtles , um , well , years ago , when I was growing up *T*-2
110049:13	's what we had intended *-1 to get *T*-2 in Houston

110080:100	thought probably 0 our neighborhood in Houston had more of this breed than any other place just because of , um , the family that *T*-1 had them \[ and , \+ and \] bred them
110171:50	run anywhere from two hundred to four hundred dollars , I think 0 *T*-2 which I thought 0 *T*-1 was a lot
110195:12	's what we 'd rather have *T*-1
110199:26	used *-1 to show Saint Bernards when I was a little girl *T*-2
110211:16	's where I live *T*-1
110213:16	's where I live *T*-1 , too
110239:20	remember when the teachers had *-1 to take the T CAT *T*-3
110302:28	is what *T*-1 provides all of your needs
110313:14	see where you would think
110331:77	do the kids , when we see them *T*-2 and they 're , you know , under the influence *T*-2
110339:23	's just our bleeding heart liberals that *T*-1 would fight it \[ to- , \+ tooth \] and nail , you know

110510:11	's how I am *T*-1 too

128809:32	guess 0 the other thing was that *T*-1 are causing a lot of the crime now is the decrease in values
128884:58	is 0 we have apartments that *T*-1 are probably about a half mile away
128959:17	seems like when the winds blow *T*-1 , \[ it 's really , \+ \] it goes right through you
128965:16	's how it is *T*-1 in Texas , too
128978:29	is I think 0 *T*-2 what *T*-1 does it

129320:23	's funny because when , you know , they interview you before you go on the jury \[ and \+ \] for capital murder *T*-1
129368:38	see why they would n't bring in the new evidence from the other case *T*-1
129440:19	know which I would pick *T*-1 if I had a choice for myself
129554:100	drink \[ with the , \+ \] uh , \[ prior , \+ \] when you have the hors d'oeuvres *T*-1
129606:28	know what we usually have *T*-1 for dessert

129720:29	quit *-1 doing it when the City took it over *T*-2
129734:18	'm so glad when they brought out those recycling bins *T*-1
129746:16	's why I asked you *T*-1
129791:21	guess 0 the ones that *T*-2 are hard 0 * to convince yourself to do *T*-1 are the ones \[ that you have *-3 to really , \+ that *T*-5 are really dirty that you have \] *-4 to wash *T*-6 out

129820:55	guess 0 there are some places , uh , in the north , in particular that , uh , *T*-1 have a real definite way of * encouraging you to recycle
129841:25	know what they could do more of *T*-1 exactly around here right now other than , uh
129851:39	going *-1 to do *T*-4 when I have a couple double A batteries 0 * to toss *T*-2 out *T*-3
129861:11	's what *T*-1 happens
129891:64	was that the driver had something on his belt that he , uh , scanned *T*-2 across the little bar code on our bin as soon as he took the stuff
129899:23	know \[ why , \+ what \] that was reading it for *T*-1
129899:31	know \[ why , \+ what \] that was reading it for *T*-1
129899:38	know \[ why , \+ what \] that was reading it for *T*-1
130005:63	think 0 to a certain degree , the reason that \[ it , \+ it \] does n't serve as a deterrent *T*-1 , uh , may be because \[ y- , \+ you \] never know if it 's going *-2 to be \[ a- , \+ applied *-3
130102:37	guess 0 there is more and more states \[ that *T*-1 are , \+ that *T*-2 are \] going back to capital punishment

136355:31	wonder how long they 're going *-2 to keep *-3 doing that for *T*-4
136472:68	do whatever *T*-3 needed *-1 to be done *-2 on the shingles
136499:86	remember where you are *T*-1 at all times

136586:21	's what it is *T*-1
136638:35	spend less time with them when they get older *T*-1
136717:60	think , uh , 0 I find myself getting my little projects going and not taking the time that I should *?* *T*-1
136835:53	think 0 that 's a lot of the breakdown of the communication and the communication that *T*-1 would take place in a family

136884:48	tell us what *T*-2 's
136886:29	been on *T*-3 that you like *T*-1
136924:26	have a brother *ICH*-3 in Minnesota that *T*-1 used *-2 to live in Wisconsin
137051:18	is where I live *T*-1
137089:39	go over to Bear Lake *ICH*-2 in the summer , which *T*-1 is kind of on the border of Idaho and Utah

137318:54	watch what \[ kind of , \+ type of \] MUMBLEx

137511:16	know why I got stuck *-1 down here in Texas now *T*-2
137584:27	's , uh , where you 're pretty much in view of the ocean almost all the time *T*-1 are n't you *?*
137626:30	hate that that 's the coach that *T*-1 's leading them
137651:38	was real upset , you know , when they fired Tom Landry *T*-1
137705:49	think , you know , 0 you ca n't really go by what *T*-1 happened earlier in the season because teams jell together or they 've had injuries that *T*-2 heal
137705:101	go by what *T*-1 happened earlier in the season because teams jell together or they 've had injuries that *T*-2 heal
137830:14	wondering where that came from *T*-1
137933:25	go , what 's this stuff *T*-1
137947:20	was amazing how a few inches of snow would turn normally sane , manly , adult men into playful little children *T*-2
138114:41	feel like , uh , \[ in , \+ what *T*-1 was available , particularly in \] the first three grades
138118:32	started what they called *T*-1 reach *T*-2
138123:46	thought 0 he needed *-1 to be exposed *-2 to a situation where he could push ahead , uh , every day . But yet still be with his peers age wise *T*-3
138156:34	thought of *-1 crossing a teacher when we were in school *T*-2
138218:50	was a big thing when they let girls wear Levi 's *T*-2
138250:26	act how you 're dressed *-1 *T*-2 a little bit
138261:31	do uniforms , although one , where he was *T*-1 between like second and eighth grade did
138335:76	suit whatever equipment you have *T*-1
138346:23	is what it 's called *-1 *T*-2
138358:118	make ornamental facings *ICH*-1 *ICH*-3 , too better than a just straight wood edge . \[ And , \+ Uh , And , \] uh , casings and so forth \[ that *T*-2 are , \+ that *T*-4 are \] real nice
138358:133	make ornamental facings *ICH*-1 *ICH*-3 , too better than a just straight wood edge . \[ And , \+ Uh , And , \] uh , casings and so forth \[ that *T*-2 are , \+ that *T*-4 are \] real nice
138379:33	is , I guess 0 *T*-3 , what they 're called *-1 *T*-2
138589:57	know that they 'll play with whoever *T*-1 's there
138605:16	know how , uh , people , uh , that *T*-1 have young kids working work full time \[ \[ and , \+ and \] \+ \] do it , really , without *-3 being stressed out all the time *T*-2
138605:39	know how , uh , people , uh , that *T*-1 have young kids working work full time \[ \[ and , \+ and \] \+ \] do it , really , without *-3 being stressed out all the time *T*-2
138640:54	think 0 for * taking kids to a , \+ probably people that *T*-1 take them to , \] uh , preschools and day-cares full time , oh , E_S they would , I do n't know , probably just feel \[ a \+ \] different
138642:27	feel such a responsibility *ICH*-1 , even when we go out for a few hours *T*-2 that
138659:48	think 0 universal health insurance , like national health , like what Canada has *T*-1
138669:21	's what the subject is about *T*-1
138681:36	think 0 it 's a trend \[ \[ that *T*-3 's , \+ that *T*-4 's , \] \+ that *T*-1 's , \] uh , probably may go nationwide eventually because I think 0 national health is something that we all need *T*-2
138681:52	think 0 it 's a trend \[ \[ that *T*-3 's , \+ that *T*-4 's , \] \+ that *T*-1 's , \] uh , probably may go nationwide eventually because I think 0 national health is something that we all need *T*-2

138681:132	think 0 national health is something that we all need *T*-2
138690:33	live in a society *ICH*-2 , though , where everyone if you ask them on polls , will , uh , say that they think that everyone has a right to health care *T*-1
138694:42	decided who *T*-1 's really supposed *-2 to pay for it
138699:15	is why people are talking about *T*-2
138716:38	been in a situation *ICH*-2 , uh , recently where I was laid *-1 off from a position as a sales manager of a company and was off work for about a year *T*-3
138774:147	proved that we 're not doing a very good job with preventive health care among children and particularly the children who *T*-1 need it most *T*-2
138796:30	pay for it , which I was n't opposed to *T*-2 *-3 paying for it
138836:24	know for sure what it was *T*-1
138852:21	remember what they call it *T*-1 , sort of like a positive , negatives or \[ some , \+ some \] kind of word 0 they use *T*-2 when \[ a , \+ \] uh , you get \[ a , \+ uh , a \] positive indication of drugs *T*-3 , E_S but \[ there 's not really , \+ there were n't really \] any there *T*-3
138852:102	use *T*-2 when \[ a , \+ \] uh , you get \[ a , \+ uh , a \] positive indication of drugs *T*-3 , E_S but \[ there 's not really , \+ there were n't really \] any there *T*-3
138857:24	are really upset about that when it comes to their rights and their rights being violated *-1 *T*-2
138932:38	know if he still does or what because I do n't know if Sam 's is actually part of it
138977:11	's what my brother was telling me *T*-1
138987:14	think what else I can say *T*-1 about that
139019:33	remember where I was *T*-1 when all that happened *T*-2
139019:47	was *T*-1 when all that happened *T*-2
139048:76	guess , 0 the rain for the past few weeks has been different than what you have *T*-1 down there
139243:56	think about that as \[ a career , \+ a normal career , \] uh , when you 're thinking of things that people might be doing *T*-1 *T*-2
139243:77	think about that as \[ a career , \+ a normal career , \] uh , when you 're thinking of things that people might be doing *T*-1 *T*-2
139256:11	's what *T*-1 brought me here
139323:14	tell me what you think *T*-1 about the Vietnam war
139335:16	is what *T*-1 \[ trigger- , \+ ultimately triggered \] us , uh , United States , uh , per se , \[ being , \+ uh , deciding \] *-2 to get out of the role of world policeman
139360:61	did \] what she did *T*-1
139371:85	made a different agreement *ICH*-1 back in \[ \[ for- , \+ the for- , \] \+ the late forties \] era that *T*-2 would have kept MUMBLEx of there
139387:11	Wonder what *T*-1 happens to this little beastie on call waiting or something
139431:11	is when they quit * sending troops *T*-1
139466:57	like \[ * to arrive , \+ \[ or , \+ or \] when they arrive *T*-1 , \] for me to be completely worn *-2 out
139468:30	's \] what
139477:14	says how wonderful it is *T*-1
139505:17	's what we had *T*-1 for a Christmas party last week
139561:71	'm in favor of very little clean up , um , very little planning because we 've got three or four couples that we get together with *T*-1 *-2 to play games
139633:35	done it \[ with , \+ \] where \[ \[ you put , \+ you cook the ri- , \] \+ well , I guess 0 you probably could do it same way , but cook the rice \] and then take a can of like cream of mushroom soup or cream of chicken soup , and put a little bit of white wine in it *T*-1
139764:23	makes it where she goes ahead and seasons up \[ the , \+ with the \] soup and the wine *T*-1
139768:69	put in garlic and onion powder or chopped onions if you want *-1 to do that , you know . What ever , however much effort you feel like *-2 putting *T*-3 into it
139768:77	put in garlic and onion powder or chopped onions if you want *-1 to do that , you know . What ever , however much effort you feel like *-2 putting *T*-3 into it
139812:38	seems like , we 've always been at a place where we 'd have *-2 to go away for the summer or something *T*-1
139909:21	know how familiar *ICH*-2 you are *T*-1 with that area of the country
140049:21	's nice and small , which *T*-1 means , you know , 0 if you do n't get the class this semester , then you 've got *-2 to wait \[ or three or four s- , \+ you know , anywhere from two to four \] semesters *-3 to get , it again
140093:24	's amazing how much character
140243:20	gave it to him when he was in junior high school *T*-1
140322:16	knew the sucker when they saw one *T*-1
140333:34	do a lot more repairs *ICH*-4 when cars were easy 0 * to work on *T*-2 *T*-3 , than I do now
140401:19	have a health problem that I need a large comfortable car
140482:43	are a lot of people *ICH*-2 down there that *T*-1 could help me with my car *T*-3
140611:34	giving us three bedrooms , which we wanted *T*-1
140612:36	Use an extra one for an office which *T*-2 is handy
140752:77	were homes *ICH*-1 in here that *T*-2 did n't have any brick at all
140781:21	's kind of why , I guess , they stuck us with more brick when there were other homes that *T*-1 did n't have any *T*-2 *T*-3
140781:55	stuck us with more brick when there were other homes that *T*-1 did n't have any *T*-2 *T*-3
140781:72	stuck us with more brick when there were other homes that *T*-1 did n't have any *T*-2 *T*-3
140817:108	guess 0 \[ every \[ \[ \[ one , \+ one \] \+ one , \] \+ one \] of them , \+ or every once in a while , \] you get one that *T*-1 's not so intelligent because this one , it
140867:33	gets \] frustrating when you take it outside *T*-1
140874:35	want *-1 to sniff around and play when it 's outside *T*-2
140884:33	praised it and given it a treat maybe when it does something outside *T*-1
140948:69	feels like it 's being killed *-1 or something when you try *-2 to , you know , tug on it *-3 to walk it *T*-4
141175:49	'm not , um , totally innocent of that because , there 's times when you just stay here , watch a tape *T*-1
141183:62	think 0 in Plano and maybe this area in Texas , there 's a lot of community activities that parents could join in *T*-1 with their kids
141210:43	's \] very hard , because when you get used to two salaries *T*-1 , it *EXP*-2 's very hard * \[ to , \+ to \] cut back to one
141236:59	had *T*-2 when you were single *T*-1
141289:11	is why we only do it once every five or ten years *T*-1
141302:19	is kind of what *T*-1 happened with ours
141303:11	is why we have not had one in a long time *T*-1
141454:73	guess 0 probably the last one 0 I went to *T*-1 I met so many people that I had not seen *T*-2 in probably \[ ten , \+ over ten \] years
141481:30	is probably why our is probably so interesting *T*-1
141519:13	know what *T*-1 is on the way yet
141598:13	is where the , kind of
141633:41	know a peace group \[ that , \+ uh , that \] \[ they \+ \] are advanced type . That they are special , well , uh , classes for peace classes
141638:11	is what their peace class is *T*-1 this year
141693:16	is what you have got *-1 to do *T*-2
141801:28	keep the radio on quite a bit when I 'm home *T*-1
141805:91	hear it from my husband *ICH*-2 when he gets home *T*-1 or , someone else

141916:21	's what *T*-1 sells papers
141977:14	's just whenever we 're , um

142097:15	find that when I ride in a cart *T*-1 , I play better
142125:51	's where
142125:93	is because it 's where , since we are a Garland resident , they gave us a special deal where you can get , uh , ten rounds of golf for a hundred dollars *T*-2
142128:19	is half price what the normal green fees are *T*-1

142514:56	take all the dogs with her when she went *-2 dog showing *T*-1

142665:13	is what he
142702:31	know what you are talking about *T*-1
142716:47	done it with the scaffolds because all the places that I had left *T*-1 for him were above huge humongous cactus
142735:26	is what we might have *-1 to do *T*-2 with this chimney
142887:40	pay him what his salary is going *-1 to be *T*-2
142944:31	know what he was doing *T*-2
143283:14	Find out where the languages are *T*-1
143374:41	find what you want *T*-2
143388:51	cut , you know , the listings , uh , in about a third when you go from three to four bedrooms *ICH*-1 *T*-2 you know , or five
143476:58	Seems like you get in that category , you 're in the three hundred thousand dollar homes or whatever
143535:57	seems like there 's \] more constraints more things that she thinks about *T*-1 . You know , openness , uh , the size of the kitchen and all this kind of stuff that I would probably gloss over *T*-2 and , maybe even ignore *T*-2 , you know

143630:127	is fascinating because one of the things 0 I 've done *T*-1 for the past few years is , uh , research the problem from the point of view of , uh , uh , what *T*-2 appears *-4 to be working best and how you can explain it theoretically *T*-3
143630:156	is fascinating because one of the things 0 I 've done *T*-1 for the past few years is , uh , research the problem from the point of view of , uh , uh , what *T*-2 appears *-4 to be working best and how you can explain it theoretically *T*-3
143650:62	think 0 there is a direct threat to vested interest in the public school system , uh , that *T*-1 will stand in the way of that progress being a little faster
143658:82	think 0 certain techniques and technologies will influence all of that as well as research , uh , uh , of the sort that people like me do *T*-3 * looking at theories of behavior and how they can be used *-1 *-1 to improve performance , particularly , uh , accelerate \[ the , \+ the \] pace of learning *T*-2

143663:16	know what form it will ultimately take *T*-1
143664:88	paying an enormous price for , uh , inferior quality when the people involved really are n't inferior *T*-1
143668:11	see what year saying *T*-1
143673:91	assume a great many responsibilities *ICH*-3 in the past thirty years that *T*-4 were n't existent , uh
143682:20	know \[ how hard , \+ how hard \] is it *T*-1 , uh , in the public school system in Iowa City
143682:30	know \[ how hard , \+ how hard \] is it *T*-1 , uh , in the public school system in Iowa City

143741:47	get out of hand and get higher \[ when , \+ when \] you start *-1 using more than a few *T*-2

143755:30	writing checks when you go *-2 shopping *T*-3
143811:11	's what I feel *T*-1
143841:79	know if it was Tennessee or Arkansas or \[ some , \+ some \] other state 0 *T*-1 had a Visa card that *T*-2 was the lowest one in the country
143846:46	see what my visa was *T*-2
143851:39	think 0 I want *-1 to find something that *T*-2 has a lower rate
143873:25	's no annual service fee , which *T*-1 is good
143904:123	guess 0 they decided *-2 to join the club and come up with \[ their own credit card , \+ another credit card \] that *T*-3 was accepted *-4
143927:50	keep the number *ICH*-1 down that you have *T*-2
143984:111	's probably apt that your call 's at this time because we just got through *-2 watching , uh , REASONABLE DOUBTS . Which *T*-1 had a , you know , capital case in it
144044:17	do whatever the hell we want *-1 to do *T*-2
144130:19	was too far away when it happened *T*-1
144158:57	were ahead \[ when I , \+ uh , when I \] left *T*-1
144158:74	were ahead \[ when I , \+ uh , when I \] left *T*-1
144204:83	think 0 they look like , uh , they 'll repeat , although , uh , here in the Bay Area people are real impressed with what Don Nelson 's done *T*-1 with the Warriors
144239:48	see what they can do *T*-1
144262:98	think 0 they 're going \] for an all time record of how many \[ l- , \+ you know , losses \] in a row \[ \[ they can , \+ they c- , \] \+ they can , \] uh , pull *T*-1 out
144356:17	know who *ICH*-2 *T*-1 would meet them in the west
144357:21	know how good Portland will turn out *-1 to be *T*-2 by the end of the year
144387:140	think \] 0 right now what they 're spending *T*-2 is adequate . Uh , \[ my , \+ for my \] personal opinion . Uh , because I think 0 it 's something that *T*-3 's going *-4 to take them a while 0 *-6 to come up with a , uh , vaccine for *T*-5
144387:226	think 0 it 's something that *T*-3 's going *-4 to take them a while 0 *-6 to come up with a , uh , vaccine for *T*-5
144412:36	guess 0 I 'm not too aware of how much they 're spending *T*-1 right now . You know
144432:11	know what I mean *T*-1
144440:79	say 0 what they 're spending *T*-2 is probably enough , simply because I do n't know that much about it
144460:30	guess 0 the area that I think more about *T*-1 is 0 I would like *-2 to see them focus on , uh , * preventing it , uh in more , You know
144508:26	know what *T*-1 's going *-2 to happen
144509:16	know who you 're going *-1 to come across *T*-2 , you know
144597:56	's the drug problem that *T*-1 needs *-2 to be addressed *-3
144629:69	see which *T*-2 is worse . Which *T*-3 is the most important 0 * to solve *T*-4 at the time
144629:85	see which *T*-2 is worse . Which *T*-3 is the most important 0 * to solve *T*-4 at the time
144662:18	's what I 've heard *T*-1
144790:67	thinking , 0 if you 've been there that long , you 've seen Plano grow from what *T*-1 was really \[ a , \+ a \] small town to a city
144833:23	know , uh , how a few bucks can be worth * shooting somebody *T*-1
144843:17	guess 0 when people do those things *T*-1 , they do n't really give a thought of the consequences at the time
144851:71	think 0 the drugs play a tremendous part in , uh , the theft and \[ the , \+ the \] violence that we see *T*-1
144859:16	know what I was doing *T*-1
144867:45	think 0 when you \] have haves and have nots *T*-6 , you 're always going *-1 to find people that *T*-2 are too lazy *-3 to figure a way 0 * to earn money *T*-7 and find 0 it *EXP*-8 's easier *ICH*-9 if you can get a gun * to go out and hold something up than it *EXP*-5 is *?* * to figure out a way 0 * to legitimately earn the money *T*-4
144867:101	think 0 when you \] have haves and have nots *T*-6 , you 're always going *-1 to find people that *T*-2 are too lazy *-3 to figure a way 0 * to earn money *T*-7 and find 0 it *EXP*-8 's easier *ICH*-9 if you can get a gun * to go out and hold something up than it *EXP*-5 is *?* * to figure out a way 0 * to legitimately earn the money *T*-4
144884:18	know where Oakland and Hatcher are *T*-1
144909:53	know that they can earn several hundred dollars in a day \[ where , \+ \] uh , you know , *-1 running for , uh , drug dealers if
144939:60	is when they started *T*-1
145095:27	think what else I can say *T*-1 in regards to this subject
145110:22	think about this \[ when you come to , \+ when it comes to \] a subject like that *T*-1
145110:40	think about this \[ when you come to , \+ when it comes to \] a subject like that *T*-1
145122:51	finding what we consider *T*-2 to be , real good child care at a , uh , pretty reasonable price , we think
145183:37	happens where we ca n't , one of us be home *T*-2
145248:20	's really what we 've learned *T*-1 about it
145255:16	know what it 's like *T*-1 around , uh , Hattiesburg
145322:20	think 0 what we 're going *-1 to go to *T*-2 is much more commercial entrepreneurial learning ventures in the market
145323:161	believe \[ that , \+ that \] there are , uh , pressing needs in the marketplace , unmet * by schools , colleges universities for , uh , * learning a lot of things that kids can learn *T*-2 *-3 watching Sesame Street and in child care
145334:20	's amazing how much good things like , uh , Sesame Street will do *T*-1
145442:17	thinking what *ICH*-3 did I get *T*-1 , that *T*-2 costs so much
145462:53	understand \] where
145506:26	know what you mean *T*-1 about the interest rates
145557:115	call \[ \[ your in- , \+ you know , \[ your , \+ your \] card , \] \+ wherever you got your card from *T*-1
145579:53	try that because \[ I , \+ I \] have one card that I 've had *T*-1 for about , uh , I do n't know , nine or ten years
145582:38	's \] what this guy
145701:39	's interesting because one thing that *T*-1 always brings to my , uh , husband 's mother 's side together is , uh , 0 they talk about the genealogy of the family tree every time
145736:21	know where the twin
145847:18	go to work when I wanted *-1 to *?* *T*-2
145874:148	work when I want *T*-3
145884:24	think 0 today the thing that I , uh , would appreciate *T*-1 the most
145921:20	is unbelievable how much you have *-1 to pay *T*-2 for it
145931:31	believe how much is our
145948:19	guess 0 \[ what , \+ \] the other benefits \[ \[ that , \+ uh , that I , \] \+ uh , that I \] miss *T*-1 , I guess is , uh , you know , some of the bonuses and stuff \[ that \+ that \] *T*-2 goes on with just * being involved *-3 with a big company , you know

145966:32	come in when \[ they were , \+ they would \] shut down *-1 to retool *T*-2
146021:31	think 0 there 's a case , where benefits have gotten
146193:15	think 0 when babies
146202:247	is 0 I can just make a T shirt and put a little ruffle around it and then , um , cut out a little pattern *ICH*-2 \[ from the material , \+ from some material , \] like flowers or something , and make , um , a design or , you know , a little arrangement or something on the shirt and , you know , fuse it on with Heat and Bond , or whatever and then paint around it
146369:16	's sort of how Matlock is *T*-1

146524:59	am in a position , uh , like when my mother gets to a point where she needs special care *T*-1 *T*-2
146524:81	am in a position , uh , like when my mother gets to a point where she needs special care *T*-1 *T*-2
146531:115	know how they feel about it *T*-1
146537:36	's more \] how they feel about it *T*-1
146546:163	think that there are some significant kinds of things 0 * to to look for *T*-4 *ICH*-1 , you know , if you are faced *-2 with * placing someone . In a place like that , uh , you know , aside from the cleanliness and the medical care that *T*-3 is offered *-5 and such
146558:34	know that the cheerful pleasant people who *T*-1 treat her kindly make all the difference in the world in how she feels *T*-2 about , uh , her situation

146596:52	think 0 it would matter too , uh , kinds of , uh , disabilities that the nursing home accepts *T*-1 . Because there are some , uh , who *T*-2 poor things , you know , do n't have , uh , any real grasp on reality any longer
146596:93	think 0 it would matter too , uh , kinds of , uh , disabilities that the nursing home accepts *T*-1 . Because there are some , uh , who *T*-2 poor things , you know , do n't have , uh , any real grasp on reality any longer
146614:42	is like , \[ wel- , \+ \] the one that I worked in *T*-1 , uh , you would see some of them just like in wheelchairs all day
146635:81	were n't \] really together with the rest of them , when they got together for such activities *T*-1
146645:36	wait *ICH*-3 , uh , which *T*-1 is happening until somebody says 0 we have *-2 to do it
146655:18	know how it is *T*-1 there
146672:16	remember where I went *-2 to take them *T*-1
146689:65	have a pilot program in Arlington *ICH*-1 *-2 going on I think in the north part of the city where they \[ are \+ have \] \[ people \+ people \] separate \[ the garbage as , \+ the trash as \] they put it out *T*-3
146693:23	is what it is going *-1 to have *-2 to come to *T*-3 . Where we are just forced *-4 to *T*-5
146693:65	is what it is going *-1 to have *-2 to come to *T*-3 . Where we are just forced *-4 to *T*-5
146696:17	's how it is *T*-1 in New York
146712:50	do what I do *T*-1

146831:53	are like , well why did n't you think of that before *T*-2
146842:67	saying why did n't you do something *T*-1
146848:23	overwhelm us here when we run out of places 0 * to put it *T*-1 *T*-2
146907:29	rains a lot *T*-1 , which is has been doing *T*-2 here a lot lately
146983:179	wear heels you know , and look like I 'm a business person . You know , because the children will tease about where 's your motorcycle *T*-4 , if you wear boots too often
147070:61	got out of \] hand when the teachers looked real tacky too *T*-1
147080:11	's how I feel *T*-1 too
147100:51	was where you thought 0 the major source *ICH*-4 was coming from *T*-3 ? Or sources
147106:11	's what , I would think *T*-1
147116:59	think 0 the automobile *ICH*-2 definitely is an area and \[ any , \+ any \] industry that *T*-1 burns , you know
147126:89	's what they were asking about *T*-1
147134:86	guess 0 there 's been a lot of pressure * to , um , do away with the C F C 's in these spray bottles which , *T*-1 has been a real problem
147142:26	's what I \] hear *T*-1
147159:25	think 0 something *ICH*-2 too that you probably see *T*-3 in older states , all \[ we , \+ we \] do it down here once in a while we will have a cold spell is where people will use their fireplaces *T*-1
147159:118	is where people will use their fireplaces *T*-1
147161:76	wondering whether it 's going *-1 to get to the point where you ca n't , do that *T*-2
147189:36	know 0 in Colorado I have witnessed that where \[ it just , \+ uh , it just \] stacks up \[ at the \+ when the \] Rockies starts *T*-1 *T*-2

147191:26	can \[ drive into , \+ when we 've been on vacation or something *T*-1 drive into \] Fort Worth or Dallas
147220:74	becoming apparent to people that the earth , which *T*-1 includes all the people on it and everything that *T*-2 's going on it , \[ is a , \+ is an \] organism of sorts , and that there is \[ a , \+ a \] whole set of organic relationships that if we start *-4 to destroy one part of it , *T*-6 it 's going *-5 to tell us about it

147225:61	think 0 it *EXP*-5 's going *-1 to be real interesting and particularly in light of what *T*-2 is obviously going *-3 to be a big structural change in the economy , uh , in this country , uh , whether people are willing *-4 to get out of their cars
147238:27	know just like anybody else how much fun it *EXP*-2 is *T*-1 * to drive
147240:156	saying that the economy is going *-2 to depend on how many cars and , houses we sell *T*-3
147245:21	's a shame too when you do see somebody driving a big car , just one person in that *T*-1
147250:58	ask you what do you
147303:14	getting where she was getting \[ th- , \+ dangerous . \] I mean letting strangers in and things like this *T*-1

147698:25	was disappointed *ICH*-1 this year when I see any of the candidates talking *T*-2 that they 're talking about
147723:14	asking what my opinion about , whether it *EXP*-1 's possible * to have honesty in government *T*-2
147728:54	is more likely if you have a small government unit where everybody knows everybody *T*-1
147733:48	think 0 maybe it just depends on how you define honesty *T*-1
147739:63	have a completely honest system of government because people who *T*-1 choose government for their positions are power seekers

149820:85	seems like you could set up some kind of like public works projects like they had *?* in the thirties , or whatever

149990:87	be where a lot of that crime is focused *-2 *T*-3
150031:92	came to the conclusion *ICH*-1 also that , you know , \[ just , \+ \] if you are walking in a downtown area , you know , where there 's a lot of crime *T*-2 , a lot of that 's going to * \[ just , \+ just \] keeping your senses about you \[ and , \+ and \] trying not * to look like a victim , you know

150080:91	know who *T*-1 had it
150187:30	seems to me that everything that I buy *T*-1 goes bad just after the warranty runs out
150243:22	was within two days that all three of these stopped *-1 working
150268:103	think 0 even if I \] \[ had , \+ uh , had \] kept the warranty , the service agreements were with the companies \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-1 manufactured

150738:24	is really amazing how fast the inches come off *T*-2
150806:91	just hearing what *T*-1 's going on
150839:60	seems that , um , they kind of get *-1 to throw their opinions into how they , you know , report on the news *T*-2

152050:48	do a lot of canoeing when we go *-1 camping *T*-2

154241:19	's basically what we do *T*-1
154312:26	focus where your money goes *T*-1
154317:30	wondering \[ my , \+ \] when you put down all the money that you do bring *T*-1 in *T*-2

154339:19	see where every penny went *T*-1
154340:34	see just what you do spend *T*-1
154346:56	found that *T*-2 helps
154356:65	\[ once that was gone , \+ well , if the entertainment amount *ICH*-1 was gone \] for the month say , oh , it 's gone

154766:58	quit *-2 taking the newspaper because I could n't recycle it anymore which *T*-1 is n't good for business on the other end either , I suppose 0 *T*-3
154774:33	got a couple of plants *ICH*-2 here that *T*-1 actually take , uh , recycled paper and shred it and spray it with chemical treatment so that it 's not a fire hazard and make it into insulation
154786:21	's why they recycle *T*-1
154792:26	making clothes *ICH*-1 now that *T*-2 are recycled
154799:47	was how can we maximize the amount of energy that we can get *T*-3 back from recycling and minimize the volume of stuff that we are putting *T*-2 into our landfill *T*-5

155153:39	tossing everything away which I always felt bad about *T*-1
155222:110	's psychological pressure against * employing people to do that kind of thing although , uh , scouts and hockey teams and ball teams , those kinds , uh , regularly do bottle drives where they go around in various neighborhoods and collect the bottles at individual homes *T*-1
155244:29	decided that the amount of information that *T*-1 would have *-2 to go in would be a lot of time * keeping that up to date
155250:77	's the only reliable way 0 * to keep a check book balanced *-2 *T*-3 actually because what *T*-1 will happen is 0 my wife will write a few checks and then , well , uh , uh , not bother *-4 to total it
155269:46	guess 0 we 've got \[ a , \+ a \] daughter who *T*-1 is eighteen months and another one on the way
155281:35	're to the point *ICH*-1 now where our financial income is enough that we can consider *-2 putting some away for college *T*-3

155328:17	know how many people *T*-1 are , uh , getting involved in this
155340:11	is how I got it *T*-1 as well

155550:16	know what I said *T*-1 to him
155619:56	know what * to do *T*-1 with them
155648:24	's also where you 're going *-1 to have a lot of people who *T*-2 are going *-3 to *T*-4

155840:58	is that they 're on a policy where they have X amount of users in it *T*-2 , okay
155873:40	tell me what he wants *T*-1
155874:31	tell me what * to do *T*-1
155900:24	is when \[ they , \+ uh , they \] pay for continuing education *T*-1

155940:11	know what I mean *T*-1
155971:62	understand how they 're supposed *-1 to be my servants and yet they 're paid *-3 more than I am *?* *T*-4
155981:112	's a \] lot 0 they need *-1 to learn *T*-3 , you know , when you get there *T*-2
156011:229	is just that , uh , \[ \[ \[ \[ \[ in , \+ for , \] \+ for , \] \+ in , \] \+ in , \] \+ in \] Congress the amount of power 0 \[ any , \+ any \] particular Congress critter has *T*-2 is based *-4 on their seniority and how long they 've been there *T*-3
156057:16	see why it makes a big difference the C I A *T*-1 because , you know , officially \[ they do n't do , \+ they do n't have \] any operations within the United States other than administrative
156066:56	think 0 \[ there are , \+ I mean there 's \] an institutional memory that you need *-1 to maintain *T*-2
156070:50	think that , uh , \[ all , \+ with all \] the perks that we 've given them *T*-1
156071:71	heard on the radio back \[ a , \+ a \] few weeks ago , uh , during the incidents where \[ they were , \+ you know , like they are n't \] paying \[ their , \+ their \] restaurant bills E_S and they 're bouncing checks all over the place *T*-1
156087:40	know what part of New Jersey you 're in *T*-1
156096:31	have , uh , actually green trees and such that you do n't notice \[ that , \+ that \] other part of New Jersey exists
156180:24	guess right now 0 \[ what they 're , \+ what they 're \] primarily worried about *T*-1 is third world countries because I guess 0 United States \[ and , \+ and \] Russia have kind of taken the lead in terms of * eliminating C F C production
156180:40	guess right now 0 \[ what they 're , \+ what they 're \] primarily worried about *T*-1 is third world countries because I guess 0 United States \[ and , \+ and \] Russia have kind of taken the lead in terms of * eliminating C F C production
156195:56	get where it is today *T*-2
156210:74	is how quickly the ozone is depleting *T*-3
156247:145	get the , uh , major pollution sources as you do out in Denver *ICH*-2 with the inversion and Los Angeles and \[ a- , \+ \] rest of California which *T*-1 is just terrible it sounds
156274:71	's almost all automobiles because there 's not that much in the way of heavy industry , you know , that *T*-1 would be causing it
156327:39	say that what you 've heard *T*-1 is what *T*-2 really is
156327:59	is what *T*-2 really is
156379:101	go really in depth on topics which I think 0 *T*-1 is good
156413:89	broadcast the Clarence Thomas hearings basically the whole length of them *T*-2 which I thought 0 *T*-1 was \[ r- , \+ really \] good
156424:31	's good when it 's live *T*-1 , \[ if you , \+ if you 'll \] really want that
156431:112	generated *-2 from that event , which *T*-3 is something that *T*-4 's good *ICH*-5 also about C Span which \[ I , \+ I \] tune into *T*-6 every once in a while
156431:127	generated *-2 from that event , which *T*-3 is something that *T*-4 's good *ICH*-5 also about C Span which \[ I , \+ I \] tune into *T*-6 every once in a while

156442:13	's what \[ you 're supposed , \+ you 're supposed \] *-1 to
156443:169	actually watching it yourself and forming your own \[ pinion , \+ opinion , \] which I \[ have n't , \+ would \] be much more in favor of *T*-4 * forming my own opinion as opposed to * following someone else 's
156489:45	got all our bills paid *-2 off when , uh , he was a Marine *T*-1
156511:16	's what I do *T*-1
156531:29	pay twice as much for it when you get done *T*-1 . You know
156585:35	write down what I 've made *T*-1 and , uh , you know , what it 's going *-2 to have *-3 to go for *T*-4 that month
156585:71	write down what I 've made *T*-1 and , uh , you know , what it 's going *-2 to have *-3 to go for *T*-4 that month
156603:37	seems like it 's absurd the number of people who *T*-1 end up *-2 having *-3 to pay somebody *-4 to do it
156632:174	understand what *T*-3 's going on
156650:26	check off what checks *T*-1 have cleared
156663:103	know exactly what I have *T*-2
156707:71	think 0 capital punishment is supposed *-1 to be primarily a deterrent to other people . You know , who *T*-2 would see it
156745:23	see kids *ICH*-3 already that *T*-1 are going *-2 to be criminals in spite of everything 0 we can do *T*-4
156750:66	do that because you got *-2 to do something with the ones that *T*-1 are already there
156757:29	guess 0 there 's other factors that
156774:43	think that there are kids who *T*-1 just ought *-3 to be taken *-4 out of their homes and reared *-4
156815:36	dealt with two or three kids *ICH*-5 today that *T*-1 are going *-2 to end up where somebody \[ has , \+ \] making a decision what * to do *T*-3 with them *T*-4

156921:42	's \] why they should have \[ s- , \+ started \] *-1 doing stuff before *T*-2
156985:101	think 0 there needs *-1 to be more of that sort of on a federal level , you know , rather than just in the places \[ where it 's , \+ you know , where it 's \] predominated so far *T*-3 , because \[ it 's , \+ you know it 's \] bound *-2 to spread
156985:126	think 0 there needs *-1 to be more of that sort of on a federal level , you know , rather than just in the places \[ where it 's , \+ you know , where it 's \] predominated so far *T*-3 , because \[ it 's , \+ you know it 's \] bound *-2 to spread
156996:46	know what the likelihood of that is *T*-1
157017:54	think \] 0 one of the main things that *T*-1 's really important 0 * to spend money on *T*-2 is education , not support \[ or , \+ or , \] research per se , \[ but , \+ but \] education because a lot of people sort of get drummed *-3 out of the work place and out of society , you know , kind of like lepers would *?* *-4 you know
157028:116	understand \] what they 're going through *T*-3 and everything

157057:128	think 0 the people that *T*-2 are committing the \[ c- , \+ crimes \] that *T*-3 would be eligible , you know , really care
157057:162	think 0 the people that *T*-2 are committing the \[ c- , \+ crimes \] that *T*-3 would be eligible , you know , really care
157097:103	is , \] what are you going *-2 to do *T*-5 about people who *T*-3 are later *-6 to have been found *-4 innocent , you know

157098:88	comes along that *T*-1 might prove their innocence
157165:44	think 0 when you listen to like \[ \[ the , uh , \+ the , \] \+ the \] victims ' families and things *T*-2 , they 're always talking about , you know , uh , *-1 feeling justified or feeling , you know , like they 've gotten something out of it
157166:76	been , 0 once the guy has been imprisoned *-1 , if he goes to jail forever or whatever , if he gets killed *-2 , it should n't make any difference to \[ the , \+ uh , the \] victim 's family
157271:14	buy whatever you want *T*-1
157320:87	go the German route , which I 'm kind of leaning towards *T*-2 right now
157354:73	brainwash themselves into *-1 thinking 0 they 're better , which *T*-3 is kind of hard 0 * to take *T*-2
157372:46	was \] amazing how they were completely opposed *T*-2
157424:14	's mainly what I 'm looking for *T*-1
157461:42	wish 0 the government would operate on the same premise that , uh , businesses operate on *T*-1
157464:11	spend what you have *T*-1
157474:27	payoff what you owe *T*-2
157475:82	get what you pay f-
157475:114	get what you pay for *T*-1
157486:90	think 0 \[ \[ for , \+ for , \] \+ for \] many years , uh , we 've paid teachers and police officers and firemen who *T*-1 are , uh , to a great extent , public servants uh
157487:22	paid them really what they 're worth *T*-2 in what they contribute *T*-3 to society
157487:42	paid them really what they 're worth *T*-2 in what they contribute *T*-3 to society
157557:129	paying *T*-3 , uh , E_S like when you buy a tire *T*-1 , you pay a federal excise tax
157616:80	thought 0 there were cases \[ where , \+ uh , I do n't know if it 's the difference between felonies and misdemeanors , but where \] it *EXP*-2 was okay for a state to have it like eleven out of twelve *T*-3
157616:136	thought 0 there were cases \[ where , \+ uh , I do n't know if it 's the difference between felonies and misdemeanors , but where \] it *EXP*-2 was okay for a state to have it like eleven out of twelve *T*-3
157620:13	's why I phrased it that way *T*-1
157625:120	be that for , uh , \[ state , \+ if there is such a thing , state \] felonies versus federal felonies that \[ federal , \+ things that *T*-1 are under federal \] jurisdiction require the unanimous vote
157627:18	know what \[ the , \+ the \] laws
157631:170	saying that if , you know , six or seven voted * not guilty , then instead of it being a hung jury , that was an acquittal
157637:173	insures the beyond a reasonable doubt , uh , criterion that it , uh , increases \[ the , \+ the \] likelihood of * getting the proper judgment
157662:57	said that usually what *T*-3 ends up *-4 happening is that , you know , after initially * finding out where people stand *T*-5 , that the whole deliberation usually results , if there is \[ a , \+ you know , something like a \] nine , three \[ or , \+ or \] more severe \[ and , \+ and \] the people in the majority trying *-6 to convince the minority that they 're right
157662:112	finding out where people stand *T*-5
157668:134	is that in the situation 0 you just said *T*-4 where it 's nine to three , or some such number *T*-5 , \[ that there 's , an effect 0 *T*-7 starts *-8 being \+ that there 's starts *-6 being \] a lot of peer pressure going on
157683:37	say that , you know , when they were the only one left * opposing the verdict *T*-1 , uh , you know , everyone was getting on them \[ so , \+ so \] heavily that eventually they just gave in *-4 knowing that nothing 0 they could do *T*-2 could stop it from * either being the verdict 0 everyone else was trying for *T*-3 or a hung jury because the one vote does n't mean anything except the ability * to not have a verdict
157732:56	went through that , too , when I was in school *T*-1
157753:63	write down how much we know 0 we 're going *-1 to spend *T*-2
157763:38	find out that , you know , no matter what kind of budget you stick on *T*-1 , there 's always going *-2 to be an unexpected car repair or something happen * with the house , that you have *-3 to have money *ICH*-6 for *T*-4 and , uh , not enough * to go and to take a loan out , but , uh , you have *-5 to have money for *T*-4
157763:119	find out that , you know , no matter what kind of budget you stick on *T*-1 , there 's always going *-2 to be an unexpected car repair or something happen * with the house , that you have *-3 to have money *ICH*-6 for *T*-4 and , uh , not enough * to go and to take a loan out , but , uh , you have *-5 to have money for *T*-4
157866:27	know how much my dad is going *-1 to give me *T*-2 every two weeks
157896:11	's why I 'm in college *T*-1
157924:13	's why I 'm planning \[ and , \+ and \] preparing for the , uh , education of my children , also try and set that money aside *T*-1
158051:13	's how we spent most of the time with him *T*-1
158089:84	think 0 with working parents \[ it is , \+ I mean , there are \] some real issues here . Um , that I think , um
158103:42	think 0 working mothers or mothers who *T*-1 choose *-2 to work outside the home , um , need very early *-3 to come to grips with any guilt , that they feel *T*-4 and decide what *T*-5 's best for them and their family
158103:114	think 0 working mothers or mothers who *T*-1 choose *-2 to work outside the home , um , need very early *-3 to come to grips with any guilt , that they feel *T*-4 and decide what *T*-5 's best for them and their family
158103:133	decide what *T*-5 's best for them and their family
158110:17	feel 0 when my children were very young *T*-2 , I had jobs that *T*-1 helped me be flexible with my schedule and spend time with them and all that sort of thing
158110:50	feel 0 when my children were very young *T*-2 , I had jobs that *T*-1 helped me be flexible with my schedule and spend time with them and all that sort of thing
158143:14	was twenty-nine when I had my first child *T*-1
158157:46	do that despite working very easily which *T*-1 is one of the things 0 I preach *T*-2 all the time \[ to , \+ to \] mothers
158164:61	think 0 we choose \[ very , \+ very \] carefully the , um , alternative situations that we had them in *T*-1
158202:32	think that there 's a crime that *T*-1 's just so heinous and so bad that the person who *T*-2 commits this crime just does n't deserve *-3 to live anymore
158202:69	think that there 's a crime that *T*-1 's just so heinous and so bad that the person who *T*-2 commits this crime just does n't deserve *-3 to live anymore
158211:29	figure out what *T*-1 would be a suitable punishment

158227:76	killed Dukakis back , uh , four years ago when someone asked him a similar question *T*-2
158228:54	thought for a second and gave a thoughtful well reasoned reply when , uh , people wanted *-1 to see if he was going *-2 to go for \[ an emotion \+ uh , a gut level \] reaction *T*-3
158232:23	think that the people who *T*-1 are strongly in favor of the death penalty are really working from that gut level . E_S Uh , you know , whether it be a biblical force , uh , you know , the eye for an eye , a tooth for a tooth , a life for a \[ knife , \+ life \] type logic or just , uh , uh , some sort of anger at * \[ putting peop- , \+ putting , uh , murderers \] up in federal pens for the rest of their life , uh , while we foot the bill
158238:31	think 0 the decisions that *T*-1 are going *-2 to be made *-3 \[ on dea- , \+ on the death \] penalty until we decide what our prison system is intended *-4 to do *T*-5
158238:100	decide what our prison system is intended *-4 to do *T*-5
158257:24	think 0 anyone who *T*-1 would commit \[ a , \+ uh , a \] crime that *T*-2 would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say , well , I was about *-3 to kill and dismember this person
158257:64	think 0 anyone who *T*-1 would commit \[ a , \+ uh , a \] crime that *T*-2 would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say , well , I was about *-3 to kill and dismember this person
158276:39	say 0 some young kids or something like that that *T*-1 might be inclined more towards a life of crime , had *-2 to sit and watch \[ and , \+ and \] see a guy burn \[ or , \+ or , \] you know , something or shot *-3 by a firing squad or something like that
158335:89	think 0 it *EXP*-3 would be very difficult * to \[ find someone , \+ uh , find a panel \] that *T*-1 would \[ be , \+ not have \] seen it \[ and , \+ and \] known of what *T*-2 was going on

158343:85	getting a jury of his peers which *T*-1 is in some ways I think 0 *T*-2 true
158368:31	guess 0 it depends on who you talk to *T*-1
158439:14	's almost when you kind of wish that there where standardized sentences *T*-1
158452:40	know \] what you were facing *T*-1
158462:58	work there long because I could n't handle \[ the , \+ the \] treatment that the children got *T*-1

158506:27	had a good system like so when you walked in *T*-1 , everything looks cool
158536:62	think \] 0 that 's one thing that *T*-1 was important
158594:47	're just there . You know . *-1 Going through this routine , which *T*-2 is lousy
158615:108	was actually the man in the group \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-2 did that side of it
158615:116	was actually the man in the group \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-2 did that side of it
158639:18	heard \[ where , \+ you know , where \] you stand in front of the clock and get your power back *-1 to control yourself *T*-2
158639:36	heard \[ where , \+ you know , where \] you stand in front of the clock and get your power back *-1 to control yourself *T*-2
158647:21	remember what they call it *T*-1 actually
158676:19	see what *T*-1 happens when , uh , they 're not funded *-2 quite as much . Or supplied *-2 with arms the same way *T*-3
158676:30	happens when , uh , they 're not funded *-2 quite as much . Or supplied *-2 with arms the same way *T*-3
158692:42	kind of cringe when they make mistakes *T*-1
158696:141	think 0 one of the most interesting things to me recently was , you know , during the war , uh , in , uh , Kuwait was , uh , the fact that they did not retaliate , for the , uh , scud missiles that *T*-1 were , uh , launched *-2 there
158737:32	question \[ or \+ \] \[ what , \+ what \] the U S -s motives *ICH*-2 were *T*-1 \[ \[ in , uh , \+ in , \] \+ in \] actually the original involvement

158764:100	see what *T*-1 happens
158893:25	go , oh , my gosh where did it all go *T*-1
158982:11	know what I mean *T*-1
159024:38	figure out how we can stop this inertia that *T*-1 's , MUMBLEx come *-3 rolling towards , whatever it 's rolling toward *T*-2 *T*-4
159024:58	figure out how we can stop this inertia that *T*-1 's , MUMBLEx come *-3 rolling towards , whatever it 's rolling toward *T*-2 *T*-4
159024:89	figure out how we can stop this inertia that *T*-1 's , MUMBLEx come *-3 rolling towards , whatever it 's rolling toward *T*-2 *T*-4
159127:57	decrease how many hours you work *T*-1 by MUMBLEx kind of percentage
159220:51	take that into consideration when I evaluate like how much I get paid *-5 *T*-2 real *T*-3
159220:65	evaluate like how much I get paid *-5 *T*-2 real *T*-3
159271:44	knows how it fits *T*-2 into the , uh , kind of the rate for different MUMBLEx
159280:33	is their insurance company which *T*-2 then translates into higher rates for all of us . If they get some of those mega awards against them
159303:79	put \[ a , \+ a \] value *ICH*-3 on somebody 's limb , uh , arbitrarily that *T*-1 is always going *-2 to fit in all cases
159307:87	think 0 maybe you look at , uh , the age of the person and their station in life \[ and , \+ and , \] uh , how much longer *ICH*-2 they have *T*-1 of work years that they would have *-3 to put up , you know , \[ with , \+ with \] that *T*-4
159307:117	think 0 maybe you look at , uh , the age of the person and their station in life \[ and , \+ and , \] uh , how much longer *ICH*-2 they have *T*-1 of work years that they would have *-3 to put up , you know , \[ with , \+ with \] that *T*-4
159313:16	be where the judiciary is a little more learned about that type of thing *T*-2 because they can be schooled *-1 in that kind of thing
159333:27	know that they 're insured
159334:50	goes all beyond their layers of insurance which *T*-1 is another pet peeve of mine when they do award punitive damages *T*-2
159334:75	is another pet peeve of mine when they do award punitive damages *T*-2
159339:64	think 0 those should have *-1 to be paid *-2 by the corporation itself \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-3 did the damage
159361:11	's what they buy insurance for *T*-1
159394:44	awarding a second amount *ICH*-2 as punishment to the company which *T*-1 is \[ a l- , \+ usually a lot \] less
159494:101	moving her up which *T*-1 is not a practical solution since both my parents work
159498:31	work . Which *T*-1 means 0 it 's , you know , very difficult for some-
159506:81	's also a lot of medical problems that *T*-1 ca n't always be completely handled *-2 in the home . Which *T*-3 makes it , you know
159514:101	are so expensive . \[ Because \+ cause \] they can afford *-2 to hire the people that *T*-3 are really going * to care for the older
159572:47	are very , you know , complaining because they remember the way that things used *-3 to be *T*-1 . And remember *-4 being able *-5 to do things *ICH*-6 for themselves which , you know , they no longer can *?* *T*-2
159572:111	do things *ICH*-6 for themselves which , you know , they no longer can *?* *T*-2
159670:11	know what I mean *T*-1
159819:13	know what I like *T*-1 \[ when it 's , \+ uh , when I like \] a sound . A certain kind of sound *T*-2
159819:52	know what I like *T*-1 \[ when it 's , \+ uh , when I like \] a sound . A certain kind of sound *T*-2
159835:13	's what he grew up *-2 listening to *T*-1
159841:44	grew up like in the late fifties E_S and you know , when they had \[ that , \+ the \] Elvis Presley music and stuff like that . And that kind of rock and roll *T*-1
159863:28	see why you went
159863:68	see why you were \] kind of sheltered *-1 I guess \[ from , \+ from \] music *T*-2
159998:18	is whatever you want *-1 to put *T*-2 in . If you put more than that or something like that
160017:25	guess 0 what we have *T*-1 is \[ like a f- , \+ what they call *T*-2 a flex \] benefits plan where \[ you , \+ you \] get like a certain amount of dollars E_S and then you spend it on a cafeteria of whatever you want or need *T*-1 *T*-3

160021:53	have one of those * use it or lose it plans *ICH*-1 , too , where , uh , they 'll basically pay for , uh , you know , child care type , uh , expenses *T*-2
160029:60	know that , like , \[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ the \] one plan that everyone seems *-1 to be in *T*-2 , in my place is , uh , you know , \[ you , \+ uh , * think 0 you \] call it *RNR*-3 plan D
160034:77	ends up 0 the best is * to take a high deductible \[ and , \+ and \] take a loss , \[ what- , \+ whatever \] it happens *-1 to be *T*-2 , if you happen *-3 to be a healthy individual

160040:169	wound up *-2 having \] *-3 to pay for , you know , a bunch of doctor visits and stuff out of my pocket because \[ of , \+ \] you know , \[ no , \+ no \] insurance policy happened *-1 to cover it , which *T*-4 is
160064:21	get two weeks when you start *T*-1
160100:14	's what

160128:25	know what they do *T*-1 for those people
160145:42	is that we do have a daughter that *T*-1 is , uh , in the situation of *-2 choosing college
160153:75	guess , uh , 0 first and foremost , \[ it , \+ really it 's \] a question of what *ICH*-3 the student wants *-1 to have *T*-2 in the way of a career and then , uh , uh , which colleges or universities *T*-4 can best offer that program
160153:138	guess , uh , 0 first and foremost , \[ it , \+ really it 's \] a question of what *ICH*-3 the student wants *-1 to have *T*-2 in the way of a career and then , uh , uh , which colleges or universities *T*-4 can best offer that program
160203:98	get *-1 to be a little bit on the smaller side where dormitory life is , uh , is right on campus as well *T*-2

160545:53	use those at work , where I work *T*-1
160604:42	think 0 you get good coverage from the sources that you have *T*-1
160625:26	get a NEWSWEEK *ICH*-2 every week which \[ I , \+ I \] pretty much read *T*-1 that cover to cover
160662:41	get kind of bored *-2 watching T V actually , when I watch the news on T V *T*-1 because it goes so slow
160674:29	's \] about what it ends up *-1 being *T*-2
160725:91	have it when it came time *T*-2
160837:44	's how they fund schools and everything *T*-2
160880:107	consider twenty percent lucky because \[ just on , \+ I mean , you know , when you figure out just on \] feds *T*-1 , you know , I actually hit the thirty-one bracket this year , which *T*-2 was no fun
160880:172	hit the thirty-one bracket this year , which *T*-2 was no fun
160911:110	think \] 0 \[ there 's some people , \+ there , \[ y- , \+ \] certainly are some things \] where you need infrastructure *T*-1
160971:117	created *-1 during the Reagan Bush *ICH*-3 era who *T*-2 are \[ suppo- , \+ supposedly \] fiscally conservative
161001:82	is what we should cut *T*-2
161081:43	got the kitten when he asked me that *T*-1
161143:67	think 0 they have \[ a , \+ a \] higher level of intelligence than other , uh , dogs that I have encountered *T*-1
161173:53	know what the best pet is *T*-1
161177:35	guess 0 it 's up to the individual and how they relate to their animal *T*-1
161284:13	's , when
161374:69	think 0 it 's important as the safety and health and that kind of stuff , is qualification of people who *T*-1 work there
161376:96	mean that they 're qualified *-1 to give the child the kind of supervision and training \[ that \+ that , \] uh
161381:96	believe that the safety \[ and , \+ and \] health , uh , issues , uh , depend in a very direct way on the people who *T*-1 are working with the children
161441:62	say , uh , 0 the types of music that I do n't like *T*-3 are opera and , uh , screaming heavy metal
161565:26	make a lot of noise when he 's , uh , so inclined *T*-1
161597:23	used *-1 to *?* , when I was younger *T*-2

161859:43	work with a guy *ICH*-2 right now that , uh , *T*-1 races catamarans in the summertime

162050:30	assume 0 it was something that she could hit *T*-1 immediately \[ and , \+ and \] really annoy a lot of people
162061:39	felt fine for the first year when she had her first set of inmates *T*-1
162079:43	was , that it , you know

162083:51	think 0 the people \[ that *T*-2 run , \+ yeah , that *T*-1 run \] the system are the most hardened and probably the most cynical , you know

162316:32	was , I think 0 *-2 , what *T*-1 really prejudiced me against American cars
162347:16	is what they go for *T*-1 on the lot

162408:84	have *-1 to hold the stock for two years before you get the company contribution which *T*-2 is , kind of \[ a , \+ a \] pain

162617:69	starting *-2 to , uh , get these hand held metal detectors so they can inspect the kids every morning when they come to school *T*-1 , of all things
162639:12	's how \[ they , \+ uh , they \] bind themselves together in groups *T*-2
162656:179	is that , instead of *-3 stealing , uh , cars like at night , breaking into them or whatever , they will pick out a car that they want *T*-4 and wait until you show up , E_S and then as you get out of the car , they just , uh , step up and , uh , take the keys off of you and drive the car away and leave you standing in front of your house

162708:18	's pretty bad when they 're using metal detectors in school *T*-1
162715:20	know \[ what , \+ what \] the solution is *T*-1
162715:28	know \[ what , \+ what \] the solution is *T*-1
162717:13	's what *T*-1 's causing all the killing
162747:63	think , uh , 0 to a large extent , they do n't understand the concept that what they 're doing *T*-3 is actually illegal because this is the way 0 they were raised *-1 *T*-2
162754:21	's the law that *T*-1 wrong in their eyes

162854:77	served out \[ his , \+ his \] sentence until it was discovered by a fellow who *T*-1 was making a documentary called * the THIN BLUE LINE that this guy had basically gotten railroaded *-2 through the judicial system
162858:52	think that there are many cases in our judicial system where justice is not served *-2 *T*-1
162865:44	talking about *ICH*-1 before , why you were chosen *-3 to be on a jury *T*-2
162865:78	think , just like you were talking about *ICH*-1 before , why you were chosen *-3 to be on a jury *T*-2 that , uh , \[ \[ the , \+ just , \] \+ the \] process of * picking jurors is not always objective
162869:52	think that they 're getting someone who *T*-2 's objective in all this
162875:41	challenged *-2 which *T*-1 is , N_S you know
162880:43	give a reason *ICH*-2 to the court why you ca n't serve *T*-3

162971:30	's the only one *ICH*-2 really that *T*-1 takes care of the office
162983:70	know 0 a lot of people around here sometimes have , like , mothers or grandmothers that *T*-1 take care of their kids
163007:66	's a lot of different types of day care available *ICH*-2 , too , you know , where they teach them academic things *T*-1
163133:15	think 0 what they need *-2 to do *T*-1 is , they need *-3 to somehow take the money out of it
163146:57	is what they 've done *T*-2
163153:12	know what *T*-1 's good and what *T*-2 is n't *?*

163155:67	use this as , uh , evidence , you know , because it was either illegally obtained *-1 or whatever
163289:54	think 0 at each Wal-Mart , they had some recycling dumpsters and things like that , which *T*-1 now
163325:66	's how \[ they do , \+ you know , they pick \] it up *T*-1
163341:103	charge people \[ * to , \+ \] I guess 0 *T*-3 when you purchase them *T*-2 \[ and , \+ and then \] when you turn them back in *T*-1

163379:33	's pretty dangerous out there , you know , when they fall over *T*-1
163489:48	started a policy of * testing drugs , which *T*-1 was kind of interesting

167126:75	realize that you 're subject to * paying , uh , income tax on something that you purchase *T*-1 mail order
167135:60	seems to me that , generally , at least in my own experience , when I purchase something mail order *T*-2 , it 's not * to circumvent *-1 paying sales tax to the State of Pennsylvania

170360:16	see how one or two people , maybe more one or two , but , you know , a number of people \[ can , \+ can \] be the downfall of \[ com- , \+ a company \] situation *T*-1

170400:38	think , uh , 0 back about , a few years ago when things were tough *T*-1 , Hewlett-Packard did that for awhile
170480:13	understand how that worked *T*-1
170484:14	's exactly how it is *T*-1 , you know
170492:24	was easier when they all had each other and could entertain each other and I was home more *T*-1
170560:46	matter what it was *T*-2
170564:23	work , uh , when I did this *T*-1
170581:16	know how \[ my , \+ my \] parents did it *T*-1
170587:23	know how my father did it *T*-1
170601:16	know how it is *T*-1 in Georgia
170624:11	's what I 've heard *T*-1
170630:79	realize 0 the cost of living is outrageous compared \[ to , \+ to \] where they came from *T*-2
170653:83	repair it myself which *T*-1 is not my cup of tea
170691:34	see how much money we can get *T*-1 out of her
170695:11	's what *T*-1 happens every time
170754:21	know what one was *T*-1
170802:16	know what the solution to that is *T*-1
170825:13	know what they 've said *T*-1
170867:28	been that most people that *T*-1 move into nursing homes die very quickly
170869:78	know whether that 's because they , you know , sort of give up hope once they get in there or what \[ the , \+ the \] reason is *T*-1
170870:32	think 0 the average length of time that somebody lives in a nursing home *T*-1 is only like six months or something
170884:91	stay where you are *T*-2
170893:11	's what my grandparents
170899:22	know what * to do *T*-2 in the event of an emergency
170913:22	get in when you want *-1 too *?* *T*-2
170922:29	is also another issue . How you 're going *-1 to pay for it *T*-2
170969:66	find \[ wha- , \+ what \] most parents would want *T*-2

171030:64	get into the headlines immediately when somebody finds out about them *T*-1
171120:116	think 0 the problems are more ones of cost and resources and , uh , pay and exhaustion and , you know , things like that , rather than these , uh , uh , really wild abuse cases that you read about *T*-1 because it make good copy
171174:64	be where you would send things through the mail *T*-2 *T*-3
171239:24	wondering what this is going *-1 to do *T*-2 in ten and twenty years
171242:67	deciding *-1 to have kids which *T*-2 generally tends *-3 to happen
171279:43	think that America is currently the type of environment where * struggling up from the bottom is necessarily considered *-1 to be good *T*-2
171297:23	know what *T*-1 's going *-2 to happen
171298:20	know 0 what I 'm seeing *T*-1 here at \[ m- , \+ my \] job is that people are having their children much later in life so that they 're establishing careers

171319:55	attended a trial in , uh , Germany when I was a student *T*-1
171347:11	's where you really need a jury of peers *T*-1
171353:15	guess 0 where I would like *-1 to see the system change *T*-2 is
171367:46	'm \[ too , \+ too , \] uh , uh , conservative when it comes to that *T*-1
171392:48	guess \] 0 I like the system that they have *T*-1 in some places where the defendant \[ gets *-3 to choose whether he 's , \+ goes before a jury for sentencing or whether the judge gets *T*-2 to choose \] it *T*-4

171406:164	need \[ more of a , \+ I do n't know , more of a \] expert types \[ to , \+ to \] be on some of these jury cases because most time you just pick , you know , Joe Blow or whoever and a good citizen or whoever \[ an- , \+ and \] call them in

172478:18	Tell you 0 what we can do *T*-1 is , uh , 0 I can punch the , uh , one

172505:64	mind that it 's only on , you know , things that *T*-1 are n't like groceries and that
172530:22	guess 0 \[ when I hear , \+ when I see \] the comparison between the United States and , uh , any other western country *T*-1 , uh , \[ their , \+ their \] rates are like , uh , forty-one , forty-two and ours are like thirty-six , thirty-seven , you know

172534:89	think that , * having lived in Europe for awhile , you know , difference in living conditions are certainly well worth , uh , what we pay *T*-1 for it
172540:45	understand what you mean *T*-1
172547:40	have what we have *T*-1
172591:93	's a dumb decision on our part because countries like Canada and England and Germany do perfectly well with a , uh , two tract system in which religious schools coexist with secular schools \[ f- , \+ with \] the same tax money *T*-1

172677:27	know how people that *T*-1 do n't have it can afford it *T*-2
172699:45	think 0 it 's really something that \[ the , \+ uh , the \] government ought *-6 to encourage *T*-1 more because , uh , there are all these complaints about how we 're not a saving country *T*-2 and where the average savings rate is something like four percent in this country and fifteen percent in , uh , Germany and Japan *T*-5

172705:56	's a lot easier * \[ to , \+ to \] save it when you do n't get your hands on it first *T*-1
172709:37	taxing it when you put it aside *T*-2
172730:74	know 0 their \] maternity leave is on the order of six weeks which I think 0 *T*-1 is too short . Uh
172734:53	think that we need *-1 to get into the mold where we talk about years rather than months or weeks *T*-2
172774:46	think 0 you 've put your finger on the one benefit \[ that I , \+ that I \] would most like *-1 to see , uh , *T*-2 changed *-3 . Uh , the , uh , parental leave

172791:58	're part of some extended family which *T*-1 is unlikely
172845:48	thought , you know , just how much of that money \[ should , \+ should *T*-2 \] go to other people that *T*-1 really do n't deserve it
172845:95	thought , you know , just how much of that money \[ should , \+ should *T*-2 \] go to other people that *T*-1 really do n't deserve it
172848:150	feel \[ like , \+ you know , just like \] you said , that , there 's just so much that you can do *T*-1 yourself . That you take care of your own self that you do n't need the money for *T*-3
172905:19	think that people that *T*-1 work for the government are just as against taxes \[ as , \+ as \] everybody else , you know
172916:117	understand \[ that , \+ uh , that , \] you know , \[ the , \+ \] uh , who *T*-1 gets benefits

172944:68	go where it 's cheaper *T*-1
172963:111	think 0 really the only place 0 you can really reduce the amount of taxes 0 you pay *T*-1 *T*-2 is *-3 to move to an area where the services are poorer *T*-4

173473:39	have older children *ICH*-2 too that *T*-1 now are out of high school
173500:25	do what Europe does *T*-1

173625:22	like what you did *T*-1
173635:135	failing \[ in that , \+ in that \] ultimate goal because there are times when people who *T*-2 are guilty are getting off *T*-3
173635:144	failing \[ in that , \+ in that \] ultimate goal because there are times when people who *T*-2 are guilty are getting off *T*-3
173636:46	's a case *ICH*-2 a few years back where , uh , \[ someone , \+ uh , someone \] who *T*-3 's \[ \[ being convicted * for , \+ was under a tri- , \] \+ was going to trial for \] murder , was let *-1 off because of a technicality in that . \[ The of- , \+ the arresting officer , \] uh , did not read the defendant their rights *T*-4

173656:149	feel \[ as though , \+ uh , \[ that , \+ uh , uh , you know , that \] \] if \[ you , \+ you 're \] a drug user you have a hidden agenda that *T*-1 's difficult unless you really go into a deep background
173664:151	figure out \] \[ who *T*-3 has a drug program \+ or who *T*-1 has a drug problem \]
173682:77	is that , uh , if you 're coming to work under the influence of any sort of drug , alcohol , whatever , or , you know , even if it 's smoking , inhibits , you know , your ability * to function , then \[ I , \+ I \] think \[ that , \+ that , \] you know , I do n't have any problem at all with * testing that individual , you know , on the spot
173683:35	feel more like whatever you 're doing *T*-1 in your own private life is your own private business
173702:79	justify what *T*-1 \[ so- , \+ seems \] like , you know , basically a breach of the \[ First Amen- , \+ you know , freedom from , uh , search and seizure , \] you know , uh , on something that *T*-2 may *RNR*-3 or may not stand as a law , you know , fifty years *ICH*-4 from now or even twenty or ten

173741:14	's why there 's , you know , people dealing it because there 's money in it *T*-1 , you know
173804:38	know exactly what , uh , uh , public education supposed *-1 to be for *T*-2 anymore
173812:49	getting *T*-1 in the parochial schools that they would n't get *T*-3 in \[ a , \+ the \] public school system
173818:86	watch what *T*-1 goes on
173822:26	saying that the taxpayer who *T*-1 also is really paying through the pocketbook for the education of the child may not be quite so conscious of the fact that they are paying the tuition for that child in the form of , uh , real estate or other taxes
173833:65	guess 0 my evidence for that is the school districts in places like California , for example , where only a minority of the taxpayers have children in school *T*-1
173835:60	are , uh , reluctant *-1 to pass , uh , school tax levies even , uh , when the money is needed *-3 or would be well spent *T*-2 because \[ it 's , \+ \] uh , they do n't have kids in the schools
173839:82	think 0 that 's \[ a , \+ a \] loss of civic virtue and a loss of , uh , uh , the cultural attitude that we used *-1 to have *T*-2 that education was first even if it was n't our kids
173858:69	believe that the original idea of public education in the United States , which I guess 0 *T*-1 was controversial at the time of the constitution . E_S Uh , you know , it barely made it
173871:19	's exactly what I was going *-1 to say *T*-2
173882:11	's what I used *-1 to think 0 education was all about *T*-2 when I was a college professor *T*-3
173882:50	think 0 education was all about *T*-2 when I was a college professor *T*-3
173885:49	know what their purpose is *T*-1
173889:20	's why I guess I 'm sort of , reluctantly , uh , in favor of these , uh , choice programs *T*-1
173894:73	is that they are very conscious of what they feel 0 they should be doing *T*-3
173896:57	find that they are also being asked *-1 to do a bunch of other stuff which they think 0 *T*-2 is only tangentially related
173899:11	's what
173956:20	wonder how we did it *T*-1
174089:19	pick whatever issue *T*-1 kind of was at a head that week
174165:37	say well what do you think 0 *T*-1 would be a fair punishment *T*-2
174191:42	guess 0 the topic is trial by jury and how we should change that *T*-2 or how we would change it *T*-1
174191:64	guess 0 the topic is trial by jury and how we should change that *T*-2 or how we would change it *T*-1
174195:19	'm ready whenever you are *?* *T*-1
174253:78	know 0 we 've got \] plenty of cases out there where people have been wrongly convicted *-1 and things like that *T*-2
174254:13	's what the trial by jury
174272:72	know what *T*-2 's going on
174294:56	know a little more about civil cases \[ when , \+ than \] criminal cases . Which *T*-1 is
174375:34	wonder \] \[ how , \+ how \] the civil system or the court system must differ between there and * say *RNR*-3 where I am *T*-1 in Minneapolis *T*-2
174375:42	wonder \] \[ how , \+ how \] the civil system or the court system must differ between there and * say *RNR*-3 where I am *T*-1 in Minneapolis *T*-2

174383:47	is completely different cause it was based *-1 on the , N_S what is it *T*-1 , E_S it 's based *-1 on common law
174401:16	see what *T*-1 happens
174482:26	think \[ when I was , \+ when I was \] younger *T*-2 that , uh , by this time we 'd have lots more \[ in \+ \] stuff in space than we do now
174482:41	think \[ when I was , \+ when I was \] younger *T*-2 that , uh , by this time we 'd have lots more \[ in \+ \] stuff in space than we do now
174491:16	know what you think *T*-1 about all that
174512:55	felt that , uh , uh , one of the long-term solutions that , at least a few of our problems would be * to have , uh , some sort of , uh , solar power satellites up
174528:106	is that you have *-1 to have , uh , lunar mining bases and space stations and easy transport into space and no MUMBLEx things that I think 0 we should be doing *T*-2
174582:27	's not what I thinks 0 *T*-1 happened
174603:11	's what *T*-1 happened with Apollo
174642:41	fry people left and right . which
174685:11	's what *T*-1 's happening here
174705:77	wish 0 if they were going *-1 to do it , they would be a little more consistent in *-3 dealing with who *T*-2 gets lethal injection and who *T*-4 does n't
174705:95	wish 0 if they were going *-1 to do it , they would be a little more consistent in *-3 dealing with who *T*-2 gets lethal injection and who *T*-4 does n't
174796:40	is what
174889:118	is \[ in , \+ 0 in \] case you are on some sort of medication that *T*-3 might give some , uh , sort of false positive result then there could be some sort of problem
174912:40	was on a couple of different prescription drugs when I was tested *-1 for Honeywell *T*-2
175071:56	only had one when she was there *T*-1
175126:36	feel like , uh , there are several areas that we 're just really , really slow in *T*-1
175204:69	admit that teachers \] have *-2 to slow things down for people who *T*-3 do n't understand , especially if there 's not a very well developed special education program at the school
175269:95	was , uh , \[ \[ \[ did we , \+ d- , \] \+ wh- , \] \+ what do we \] think *T*-2 about a judge making the decision
175279:26	know what I mean *T*-1
175296:13	's why jury selection is often very difficult *T*-1 . Uh
175299:31	saying , uh , you know , what new ways \[ could y- , \+ could it , \] \[ you , \+ you \] know , change the system *T*-1
175326:23	think 0 the only people who *T*-1 benefit from that are the lawyers
175332:47	think that the lawyers have caused a lot of the problems \[ tha- , \+ that \] *T*-1 exist \[ in the s- , \+ in the criminal system \] today . With plea bargaining
175332:55	think that the lawyers have caused a lot of the problems \[ tha- , \+ that \] *T*-1 exist \[ in the s- , \+ in the criminal system \] today . With plea bargaining
175346:14	's MUMBLEx what I 'm saying *T*-1
175349:16	know how it works exactly *T*-1
175362:26	know what I 'm saying *T*-1
175371:145	think 0 if a person is guilty of *-1 taking someone 's life and like you say , \[ \[ it 's , \+ it 's , \] \+ there 's \] no doubt whatsoever . Like drunk drivers that *T*-2 kill people
175454:78	find out whether it 's premeditated or what the circumstances were *T*-3
175475:68	think 0 the biggest benefit or the biggest benefit other than wages \[ \[ that , \+ that , \] \+ uh , that \] anybody could get *T*-1 \[ in , \+ in \] * dealing with a large company is * to be in a situation where \[ you , \+ you \] get *-4 to know what *T*-2 's going on *T*-3
175475:76	think 0 the biggest benefit or the biggest benefit other than wages \[ \[ that , \+ that , \] \+ uh , that \] anybody could get *T*-1 \[ in , \+ in \] * dealing with a large company is * to be in a situation where \[ you , \+ you \] get *-4 to know what *T*-2 's going on *T*-3

175475:169	think 0 the biggest benefit or the biggest benefit other than wages \[ \[ that , \+ that , \] \+ uh , that \] anybody could get *T*-1 \[ in , \+ in \] * dealing with a large company is * to be in a situation where \[ you , \+ you \] get *-4 to know what *T*-2 's going on *T*-3
175475:205	know what *T*-2 's going on
175480:112	feel like , uh , when I start *-1 talking about benefits *T*-2 , \[ I talk about , \+ I 'm concerned about \] medical benefits
175496:36	're changing * doing other kinds of things . Which *T*-1 to me \[ is , \+ is \] disturbing
175500:47	know what *T*-2 's going on and what *T*-3 's happening
175500:66	know what *T*-2 's going on and what *T*-3 's happening
175530:44	did n't . \[ And , we , \+ \] which *T*-1 was \[ a , \+ \] kind of stupid
175533:58	see what sort of things we do *T*-2
175533:82	are going *-1 to come around and see what sort of things we do *T*-2 . Which I thought 0 *T*-3 was kind of interesting \[ \[ and , \+ But , \] \+ uh , but \] \[ that , \+ that \] \[ sort , \+ sort \] of thing
175540:69	understand what *T*-1 's going on
175548:54	think that one of the major , uh , situations , especially when you reach , you know , \[ the , \+ the \] mid-fifties *T*-1 , \[ wa- , \+ is \] * keeping a job until you retire
175577:55	see what he can do *T*-5
175577:75	needs *-1 to do his own course of investigation \[ and , \+ and \] see what he can do *T*-5 because who *T*-2 knows what *T*-3 's going *-4 to happen in another thirty years
175577:86	knows what *T*-3 's going *-4 to happen in another thirty years
175589:71	is \[ what he , \+ what he \] was working on *T*-1
175589:83	is \[ what he , \+ what he \] was working on *T*-1
175599:77	is when , uh , people call and \[ they , \+ uh , you \] have solicitation calls *T*-2
175613:92	get those calls \[ and , \+ \] you know , when you 're sitting at home wanting *-1 to relax \[ or , \+ or \] whatnot *T*-2 *T*-3
175691:99	heard recently \[ that , \+ uh , uh , that \] this is a common occurrence where people are using s- , you know
175734:97	see 0 it was incremental , uh , decisions . Any one of which *T*-1 was sort of understandable at the time *T*-3
175741:93	was just , uh , in high school I guess 0 *T*-2 \[ when it , \+ when it \] ended *T*-1
175741:105	was just , uh , in high school I guess 0 *T*-2 \[ when it , \+ when it \] ended *T*-1
175754:23	understood what our purpose *ICH*-2 was *T*-1 over there
175755:40	do anything when we went over *T*-1
175763:21	's how they tend *-1 to talk about it *T*-2
175785:49	thinking in the course of * talking to him about it , how , uh , in World War Two , the personalties of Stalin , Hitler and Churchill more or less defined the war *T*-1
175805:27	felt like this was a place where we could draw a line , beat them and they would n't come forward *T*-1
175818:94	think 0 we did \] learn some lessons that \[ we were n't , \+ uh , we were n't \] prepared for *T*-1
175828:30	knew \] who *T*-1 was good
175829:11	knew who *T*-1 was bad
175833:118	know whichever way it is *T*-1
175866:39	think 0 that was one of the biggest , N_S that , you know , \[ \[ the , \+ uh , th- , \] \+ the \] domestic unrest
175874:13	's why I concentrate on weekly magazines *T*-1
175883:125	like the weekly magazines , uh , because \[ i- , \+ it \] gives me , you know , the high points of what *T*-1 's going on
175926:109	's a good thing when any given group is being accused *-4 by each side of , uh , * favoring the other side *T*-5
175947:14	know exactly where that is *T*-1
175957:38	been impressed with *T*-1 it when I 've read it at times *T*-2
176023:11	is how I discovered , you know , \[ the que- , \+ the Prime Minister 's , you know , question \] and answer period *T*-1 , you know
176027:91	is much higher than , generally , in American politics , uh , which I really enjoy *T*-2
176096:19	was that whenever something *ICH*-4 went on sale that I really had *-3 to have *T*-2 *T*-1 , I would have the cash * to buy it right then and there . And not ever have *-5 to spend any money on interest
176096:40	went on sale that I really had *-3 to have *T*-2 *T*-1
176136:72	have enough \[ of a , \+ of a \] cushion in the bank so that when they come *T*-1 , I can pay them in full
176152:95	had two kids *ICH*-2 in college that *T*-1 just have graduated in the past year
176186:27	take care of the kids when they were school *T*-1
176223:53	'm a much better mother when I work out of the home *T*-1
176232:16	is sometimes what some women who *T*-1 have *-2 to work
176232:27	is sometimes what some women who *T*-1 have *-2 to work
176277:43	's real important that you have a place that , first of all parents have a lot of input into *T*-1 and that they 're always welcome and that they have a lot of activities where parents come in during the day *T*-2 and that at any time you can drop in
176277:126	's real important that you have a place that , first of all parents have a lot of input into *T*-1 and that they 're always welcome and that they have a lot of activities where parents come in during the day *T*-2 and that at any time you can drop in
176285:67	see what they were doing *T*-1
176358:31	guess 0 baby-sitters now are up at , what , five dollars an hour
176364:42	made the comment *ICH*-1 earlier , why would someone be interested in children *T*-2
176495:20	do *T*-1 when your kids were growing up *T*-2
176514:33	stand how she was taking care of my child *T*-1
176534:11	's what he got *T*-1 , you know
176599:60	got some very definite , uh , opinions about it *ICH*-1 . Uh , you know , which *T*-2 have n't changed all that much from my first reactions \[ from , \+ from \] \[ when they , \+ when they \] announced it *T*-3 . But , uh , developed a little more , I guess , but have n't changed that much
176599:118	got some very definite , uh , opinions about it *ICH*-1 .

But , uh , developed a little more , I guess , but have n't changed that much
176605:51	do that . Uh , although , uh , I had an ex-employer that
176612:27	is that certain jobs that when there 's immediate threat to life and limb , uh , if should somebody be under the influence of drugs *T*-1 , \[ I , \+ I 'd \] be willing *-2 to support that
176617:66	was an incident *ICH*-1 several years ago where an Amtrak engineer MUMBLEx you know
176642:18	's the government that *T*-1 's mandating it to a certain extent
176675:66	agree that \[ there are , \+ there are , \] uh , jobs that *T*-1 are definitely life threatening
176692:129	give credit *ICH*-2 \[ to , \+ to \] \[ our , \+ our \] company for *T*-1 in \[ that , \+ that , \] I think 0 \[ there 's , \+ there 's \] a couple of levels of tests in terms \[ \[ of , \+ of , \] \+ uh , of \] drugs
176700:144	determine exactly \[ what the , \+ what the \] things are *T*-4
176700:156	determine exactly \[ what the , \+ what the \] things are *T*-4
176752:30	get together . Because when I had my last big project *T*-1 , I had the contractor do the framing
176797:16	's just what I have *-1 to do *T*-2 *ICH*-3 *ICH*-4 , more or less , around the house , you know , for my parents
176811:32	knew how
176811:47	knew how \] * to do the framing *T*-1
176813:21	knew how * to do most of it *T*-1 , you know
176962:39	was n't , uh , cheaper where you are *T*-1
176992:30	was just when I was a kid *T*-1
176993:21	know what the cost of living is even like *T*-1 in Dallas anymore
177004:19	's probably about what you 're paying *T*-1
177020:147	feel as though , uh , \[ jury trials \[ are , \+ are , \] \+ uh , whatever system *T*-1 has \[ been , \+ been \] \] used *-3 historically , in particular jurisdiction , you know , is really \[ the , \+ the \] only kinds of things that you can use *T*-2 . Because \[ the , \+ the \] jurisprudence is , you know , based \[ \[ on , \+ on , \] \+ uh , you know , on \] accumulated \[ n- , \+ body \] of law
177020:249	feel as though , uh , \[ jury trials \[ are , \+ are , \] \+ uh , whatever system *T*-1 has \[ been , \+ been \] \] used *-3 historically , in particular jurisdiction , you know , is really \[ the , \+ the \] only kinds of things that you can use *T*-2 .

177033:54	wonder , uh , had the jury been a different group of people what *T*-1 would have happened with that outcome
177034:133	witnessed what we did *T*-2 with the video tape beating
177081:16	understand why they were upset *-2 by the verdict *T*-3 just because even those of us that *T*-1 are n't black or , uh , do n't live there or whatever , we all saw the same thing \[ on the , \+ on the \] tape
177081:62	understand why they were upset *-2 by the verdict *T*-3 just because even those of us that *T*-1 are n't black or , uh , do n't live there or whatever , we all saw the same thing \[ on the , \+ on the \] tape

177098:46	determine , you know , \[ how you address , \+ how you weigh , \] you know , Rodney \[ getting , \+ getting \] the hell beat *-1 out of him against , you know , forty deaths *T*-3
177098:61	determine , you know , \[ how you address , \+ how you weigh , \] you know , Rodney \[ getting , \+ getting \] the hell beat *-1 out of him against , you know , forty deaths *T*-3
177139:33	's \] exactly how I feel *T*-1 too
177148:11	know how capital gang , they always say well inside the beltway , they think thus *T*-1
177166:105	is because Rick , who *T*-4 's another government employee wanted \[ a spe- , \+ segments \] of my speech , \[ that \+ that \] *T*-2 were done *-3 a year ago

177183:37	's why

177199:51	think \] when we come to a time of recession *T*-1 that it *EXP*-2 's particularly important that we shut our doors at that time
177224:143	is that people are not willing *-1 to discuss it , uh , \[ in , \+ in \] terms of what , uh , *T*-2 really is driving it
177226:51	believe 0 there are two policies \[ that , \+ uh , that \] the government uses *T*-1 *-2 to modulate immigration

177250:58	close off the Mexican border . Not because it 's physically impossible but because the explosion that *T*-1 would take place in Mexico \[ would be , \+ uh , uh , would spill \] over to this country
177261:71	been involved in * causing the problem \[ that , \+ uh , in that \] they 're pretty miserable where they are *T*-1
177261:104	're pretty miserable where they are *T*-1
177290:100	know how it is *T*-3 someplace else
177302:43	think , 0 probably \[ your , \+ a great deal of what you \] say *T*-1 is true about the legals
177365:133	think , uh , that you can do *T*-1 about it \[ \[ in , \+ in what , \] \+ in Los Alamos
