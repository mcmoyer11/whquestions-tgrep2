cuny/salt abstract scratch

Meeting notes:
- General guiding question, from a theoretical perspective what should happen?
- literatuer predicts a bias for ma over ms

- a: doesn't seem to be a bias in the first place (where you can tease them apart)
- include cases where a is preferred to all, and 

- in the method section, ideally we would ask for MS vs MA
for many cases, the two interpretations were the same (give examples)

- if looking at the other bars
- take all the cases for which 'other' received a high r

- renormalize the distributions
for each item, compute means for each para
if the mean is highest for 'other', throw in to one bucket
proportion of items that received a high 'other' rating

report that we are excluding these

- framing:
there are many theories of (non-)exhaustivity in qs.
what is the consensus? (what do people agree about)--MA default

baseline intuition data.
additional observations regarding wh and modal
- but none of these intuitions come from actually looking at the way real people produce real language
- in order to strengthen the empirical landscape on which theory building proceeds, we're going to look at a corpus of naturally occuring speech
- get naive participants judgements 

Step 1: Tgrep database
empirical considertaions 
report descriptive Stats
how many contain modals
how many whs.



Step 2: get the 
(1) is there variability? do we see the bias for MA answers?
(2) are the observations made previously supported by the data?
 be sure to report why some were excluded?
 

conclusions:
no bias
observations not as cleanly supported
leads to a methodological conclusion about 
problematic for the purpose of theory building about examples that people come up with on the fly about input data

point out where the results of Moyer \& Syrett are replicated.

- not useful thinking about a default that can be overidden, but that a listener has to figure out the interpretation...consistent with constraint-based 

First step, limited, questions about whether it will replicate in other corpora, once we take in to account embedded questions...

Mixed effects without 'other'-preferred paras (see how many are left)
report p values
