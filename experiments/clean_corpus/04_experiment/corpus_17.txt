98593:18	so we don't know what *t*-1 is really going on, what *t*-2 is, uh, really the range of sentences or awards that *t*-3 are, uh, are actually, uh, in the end applied *-4.	###speakerb27.###uh-huh.###speakera28.###uh, and many of those get overturned *-1 or get reduced *-1 in terms of sentences, or get changed *-1 by a judge or an appeals court###speakerb29.###right.###speakera30.###and that never makes the, the press###and so, when, uh, you or i as an individual gets on a jury *t*-1 we tend *-2 to have certain mental images of what *t*-3's what because we see the headlines, uh,###and we don't have, a-, again, a lot of knowledge,	what	no	what *t*-1 is really going on	...what is a thing...	...what is every thing...	...what is the thing...	
13644:173	uh, now i think 0 the change that i've seen *t*-1 as much as anything is one where couples, uh, are more carefully planning their intention on how *-3 to both share homemaking duties *t*-4 and also how women will, uh, have their children and then deliberately sort of plan how they go back to the work place *t*-6 *t*-5 *t*-2.	###well, i guess 0 i would first identify myself as middle aged###and therefore, *-1 having seen the last generation, i guess 0 it puts me in, you know, gives me a perspective on that.###speakera3.###uh-huh.###speakerb4.###speakera5.###yeah.###speakerb6.###uh, i, am quite positive on the things *ich*-2 that i have seen *t*-1 happen recently relative to women in, both in society and in the work place,###uh, there's no doubt about the fact that when i was first graduated *-1 from college *t*-2 the impression was that a woman's career would consist of a childbearing years and perhaps *ich*-3 a return to the office, but not necessarily.	how	no	how they go back to the work place *t*-6	...what is a way...	...what is every way...	...what is the way...	
28491:37	and, um, so they didn't know how it was going *-1 to work *t*-2,	###speakerb46.###if i had a machine already installed * at home i would probably work just about every night.###speakera47.###one of the reasons why i got mine *t*-1, was 0 before i went on maternity leave, they didn't know how they were going *-1 to do without me *t*-2 at work because, i am pretty much the, like you said, the guru, in the office with the different programs and mumblex any trouble shooting that there is *t*-1,###speakerb48.###yeah.###speakera49.###speakerb50.###huh-uh.###speakera51.	how	no	how it was going *-1 to work *t*-2	...what is a way...	...what is every way...	...what is the way...

61712:56	but if they were careful, they could make the use of it totally without * understanding how the computer works *t*-1.	###but you know i never really learned *-1 to operate one.###speakera13.###oh, that's a key thing.###well, actually that's a,###there's really two issues to that that there's so many software packages available *ich*-2 today. that *t*-1 just require no programming.###speakerb14.###yes.###speakera15.###so that yo-,###in other words when someone built that software packet *t*-1 they had *-2 to use the programming	how	no	how the computer works *t*-1	...what is a way...	...what is every way...	...what is the way...	
118736:57	maybe i, maybe it's, you know, 0 i'm reflecting how i feel *t*-1 about it,	###and uh,, you know, of course i, i'm sure 0 we have some enemies down there who *t*-1 wouldn't care what *t*-2 happened to us,###speakera17.###right.###speakerb18.### but but that is, that's a tough deal,###speakera19.###that's true.###speakerb20.###and it,###i don't think that,	how	no	how i feel *t*-1 about it	...what is a way...	...what is every way...	...what is the way...

99169:72	and when you mentioned that *t*-1, we, we have friends who *t*-2 have children *ich*-4 there who *t*-3 just love it.	###but, uh,###speakera62.###well, th-, that's certainly,###uh, especially today with the cost of college.###i mean that is a, a major, uh, consideration###and i do feel fortunate that texas has so many good schools.###and even though baylor, uh,###speakerb63.###yes.###speakera64.	who	no	who *t*-3 just love it	...who is a person...	...who is every person...	...who is the person...
